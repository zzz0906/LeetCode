## Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Just same as binary number to a 10-based integer.

First iterate linked list to get the maximum exp. 

Then iterate linked list and each time exp / 2;

AC.

## Insertion Sort List

147.. I have done it before! Please see it in the 147.

## Consecutive Characters

just record the last character and last existing times? It's so easy.


and return the max existing time? O(length)

AC!
