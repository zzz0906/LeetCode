## Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Just same as binary number to a 10-based integer.

First iterate linked list to get the maximum exp. 

Then iterate linked list and each time exp / 2;

AC.

## Insertion Sort List

147.. I have done it before! Please see it in the 147.

## Consecutive Characters

just record the last character and last existing times? It's so easy.


and return the max existing time? O(length)

AC!

## Minimum Height Trees

the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are called minimum height trees (MHTs).

return the max degree's nodes?

I feel like this theory is correct...

Oh my idea is correct? oh...no...there are some difference

It shall be the topology of the nodes' degree.

AC!

## Add Two Numbers II

High precision problem...use linked list to simulate the two sum of two integers

I need to use reversed order it's n^2 if we keep iterating

if n^2 space 

the std use stack...instead we can also just use vector.

C++ class must be **new**!!

AC! This problem let me review how to do the higher precision.

remember the last carry.
