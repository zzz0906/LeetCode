## 130. Surrounded Regions

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

[also done before](../Insights/130.md)

We know that if a O in the matrix contains a 'O', it must connect to the edge. The solution dfs from the edge position and turn all these O into $. And finally, this $ will turn into O and others will all be X!

YES. RE AC!
