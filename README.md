# LeetCode Recording

Practicing my programming skill day by day

Record my insights or std's solution

I labeled problems according to its best solution's algorithm. If there is no fixed type of algorithm, I will labeled it trick (use brain, no template algorithm). Also, if I do not list it in the summary table, it means that the problems are easy enough to finish it in my sophomore.


* **Scripts** folder is use to store my accepted code. you can copy it to submit. But I recommend you to read my code and insights then write your own code.
    1. C,C++,Python3,Java. I will choose one given by my mood. I'd like to learn GO in the future and add it.

    2. xxx_std means I use some one else code (because it's a easy question or easy to implement (lazy) or too hard (I can't do it!')). Basically I use [grandyang's code !](https://github.com/grandyang/leetcode), Thanks for his help!

* **Insigt** folder is use to record my insights, if you cannot understand the code, please find my corresponding insight file and read it. (My solution may not be the best)
* **Year_Month** folder gives [daily challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/) in leetcode. I only finish weekdays' problems. Readme in this folder give the insights.


## Valuable Problems

* Hard to associate them with a fixed algorithm

1. [233]() Number of Digit One
2. [262]() Trips and Users
