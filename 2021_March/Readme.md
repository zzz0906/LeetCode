## Distribute Candies

DP, right? So DP style.

Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.

-10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5

Bucket?

200000 = [-100000,100000] => [0,200000]

we tag 1 and iterate over 200000.

## Intersection of Two Linked Lists

n^2 iterations?

Find the first same node?

160. I have done it before. let me just copy my code.

## Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

I seem to need to find the longest palindromic subsequeces?

NOPE...it cannot let remove time be shortest.

I think it need dp or brute force.

s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

aabbaa

HINT: Are subsequences composed of only one type of letter always palindrome strings ?

Fuck...so the maximum answer is 2.

we only need to detect it can be removed by once. It's a palindrome!

AC...

## Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

It's a DP?

It's hard to think the equation in a short time.

DP[i] = DP[i - coins[i]] + 1

Genius! Max = amount + 1; dp[0] = 0;
