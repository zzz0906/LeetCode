## Distribute Candies

DP, right? So DP style.

Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.

-10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5

Bucket?

200000 = [-100000,100000] => [0,200000]

we tag 1 and iterate over 200000.
