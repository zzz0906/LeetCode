## 398. Random Pick Index

Given an integer array nums with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the array nums.
int pick(int target) Picks a random index i from nums where nums[i] == target. If there are multiple valid i's, then each index should have an equal probability of returning.

record the position at the begin? Easy question

map -> index -> position -> random size

yes ac! attention: do not need initialize the time seed.
