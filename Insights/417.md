## 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Memory search? Record each node whether can flow to Pacific and Atlantic both. If search this node again just return false?

the things we need to remember is core. we only seach its as the beginning of the dfs as the records.

this idea is correct. But TLE...

so, it's a DP question?

yeh! it's a DP! from edge to center!

no time more. Use the std...

yes, use dfs from edge to center...

write the code more beautiful!
