## 343. Integer Break
Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

10 = 3 + 3 + 4

I guess in the middle is the biggest?

//p1 + p2 + p3 = n
//p1*p2...pn
//3 2 1; 4 2 2; 5 2 3; 6 3 3; 7 3 4; 8 4 4; 9 3^3 = 27; 10  3 3 4; 11 3 3 5 = 45; 3 3 3 2 = 54;
// DP?

we need to find p1*p2; p1 + p2 = k; dp[p1]\*dp[p2] is the answer? dp!

but also need to consider i*j not in dp! it self division is huge!

AC!
