## 423. Reconstruct Original Digits from English

Given a string s containing an out-of-order English representation of digits 0-9, return the digits in ascending order.

Approach: The idea is to first count digits that can be identified by unique characters. Four such digits exist -

'z' occurs only in "zero".
'w' occurs only in "two".
'u' occurs only in "four".
'x' occurs only in "six".
After we're done counting the occurences of these 4 digits, new identifiers come into sight -

In the absence of "four", f now occurs only in "five".
In the absence of "four", r now occurs only in "three".
In the absence of "six", s now occurs only in "seven".
In the absence of "zero", "two", and "four", o now occurs only in "one".
Similarly, applying a similar logic to the remaining digits -

'h' is now unique to "eight".
'n' is now unique to "nine".
Just type in this logic as code and we're done!
