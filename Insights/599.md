## 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

common => Easy to think of hash table. We can use hash table map string value to minimal index. And if the sum of index is equal to the current minimal index we can add it to the result. Otherwise we can update the current minimal index.
