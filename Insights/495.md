## 495. Teemo Attacking

Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.

You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.

Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

just scan the array, and next interrupt time point is array[last] + duration - 1, if array[cur] > array[last] + duration - 1 indicates that we need to accumulate answer array[last] + duration - 1 - array[start] to the answer. What is start? start means current start round of poison. Because Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, so we need to store a inital start of the poison starts and update it end time until array[cur] > array[last] + duration - 1, we accumulate answer array[last] + duration - 1 - start + 1 to the answer
