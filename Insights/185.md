## 185. Department Top Three Salaries

Last problem same method. However...This version of MySQL doesn't yet support 'LIMIT & IN/ALL/ANY/SOME subquery'

I still look into other's solution. I found that we need to use count(biggher than current salary) < 3 which means its rank is in 3.

Then we need to sort the top 3 through 'order'!
