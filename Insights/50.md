## 50. Pow(x, n)
It's a really HARD QUESTION TODAY. I do not know how to solve this. Maybe we can use quick power or something.

So, let us try quick power. We use recursive to implement this problem. 

for 2^n we can compute 2^n/2 * 2^n/2, but, if we compute 2^n/2 * 2^n/2
WE NEED TO COMPUTE THE X N

FIRST WE NEED TO GET X N/2
THEN WE LET RES = X N/2

RES * RES = X N

YES!!! accepted! I am so clever!
