## 131. Palindrome Partitioning

I feel a little hard of this question. DFS 2^[length of string]. where to split it.

And remember DP! can we use DP?

THE STD is DFS. 

I think I just use std. I don't want to write dfs again.

The dfs in each turn find the split point from start to the string end.

I thought we can use whether we split in this point or not. It seems like the std program. But more recursive space needed.
