## 132. Palindrome Partitioning II

BFS? from split into 2 and split into 3 .... string.length (each char as the palindrome)?

NOPE!! **DP** again! f[i] represent from 0-i the minimum cuts needed.

for [0-i] we can transfered from [0-j] and [j+1,i] and we can know that the minimum cuts can be f[j]

and when f[j+1,i] is a palindrome then we can get the minimum cuts. we for loop all before value. 

Because the ansewr must be transfered from before cut in j and then cut in j!

Also, we use a p[i][j] to record whether it's a palindrome form i to j

and p[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) && p[i+1][j-1] 

Then we can update when p[j+1,i] then f[j] + 1
