## 371. Sum of Two Integers


Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -.

First, we must use bit operators. 

For a binary code, essentially, we only perform the actual sum and actual carry. 

sum rule:

0+0=0，0+1=1, 1+0=1，1+1=0

carry rule:

0+0=0, 0+1=0, 1+0=0, 1+1=1

Hint: 0x7fffffff << 1 to let the first number be the zero after that then perfor << 1;

AC!

We perform add sum + carray until carry = 0
