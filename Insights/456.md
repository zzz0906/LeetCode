## 456. 132 Pattern

Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

We need to do it in o(nlogn) time complexity.

for the value i < k < j

first we sort the value by index.

and we scan it. Can we use priority queue here?

for example, if the value is greater than current value, but the index is smaller, it's meaningless for our problem right? so we only need to push the index when the index is larger, like 1,3,5 when we find a smaller index. we need to see whether the last one is greater than current.

oh!!! we can use stack. we know more huge value in the middle is better for the rest integer. Because we need to find smaller, more smaller is better.

and we use a pop to record the second. we do it in reverse order. And for the second we need to keep it as much bigger as possible. Thus, we will save the biggest in the stack. And when there is bigger one, we will pop out the stack that who cotain the biggest in the past as the second one!

AC

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
