## 566. Reshape the Matrix

n MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

If we use python we can do this easily by using default reshape function. But in c++ we need to create a new array and continue add it when we % reshape value then make new dimension array.

AC! because we flat the list thus the space is a little bit higher. But we can append the value directly, ac!
