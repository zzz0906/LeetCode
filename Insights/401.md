## 401. Binary Watch

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

For example, the below binary watch reads "4:51".

Given an integer turnedOn which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

For example, "01:00" is not valid. It should be "1:00".
The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

For example, "10:2" is not valid. It should be "10:02".

It's a problem of combination? 

H: 8 4 2 1 PM

M 32 16 8 4 2 1;

The maximum turn-on lights can be 3

oh my idea is totally wrong.

It can be turned on in several lights. like 8 4 => 8 + 4 = 12 pm

let me see the std;

oh we can observe that, each number  in this binary watch only cotain only single 1 in their binary form. Thus, the num represent the number of 1 we can have. 

Also, the std use bitset to transfer a decimal system to binary system.

```
A bitset is an array of bool but each Boolean value is not stored separately instead bitset optimizes the space such that each bool takes 1 bit space only, so space taken by bitset bs is less than that of bool bs[N] and vector bs(N). However, a limitation of bitset is, N must be known at compile time, i.e., a constant (this limitation is not there with vector and dynamic array)
```

32 = 2^5; thus we need to move the hour's binary number to the 6.

bitset<10> ((h << 6) + m).count() == num
