## 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

can we summarize the number of maximal existing characters in any substring?

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length

26...can use some prefix sum for the 26 upper case letters? n^2 seems not acceptable.

How about binary search the length of the answer. still summarize the number of each letter's count as a prefix sum.

If the length is too long => we cannot find any replacement under the k! let try it! (use i,j's maximal count and other words's number)

Holy! AC!

Let me see the std' answer it's an easy slides window..

it's clear that we can move the left to satisfy the k's condition.

Actually, we are enumerating the left points, and move the start to fit in the condition that the maxlength for the start points - maxcount < k. If not, we will move the start.
