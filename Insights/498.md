## 498. Diagonal Traverse

Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order.

I done this problem in my interview. We can turn them in the same direction from first column 0 to n - 1 and last row 0 to n - 1. And reverse 1,3,5, all odd number traverse and combine them into an answer;

so I just copy std. But there is a code so elegant:

r, c = 0 if d < M else d - M + 1, d if d < M else M - 1. It use one line target = a if xxx else b to represent one value and use a,b = c,d to represent a = c, b = d; Overall ``` r, c = 0 if d < M else d - M + 1, d if d < M else M - 1 ```

so elegant code. code tricks used in py:

* 1. a,b = xxx if else xxx, xxx if else xxx
* 2. [::] to reverse a list
* 3. extend to extend a list
