## 224. Basic Calculator

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open ( and closing parentheses ), the plus + or minus sign -, non-negative integers and empty spaces .

I decide to use py3 this time. python string!

1. delete space first
2. **non-negative** integers means we can just use stack
3. the value more be more than 10

It still have negative after we do the minus and add...

AC...just modify my code for each test case, it's so not robust.

I also need to determine last operation is '-' or number to record whether I need to add the last number.

also if it's negative number -- = + +- = -
