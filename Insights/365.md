## 365. Water and Jug Problem

It's a really tricky problem. 

We need to find a pattern.


Fill 3, pour into 5.

Fill 3 again, pour into 5 until full, leaving 1 gallon remaining in 3 jug.

Empty 5 jug.

Pour 1 gallon in 3 into 5 jug.

Fill 3 again and pour into 5 jug that already has 1 gallon in it.

4 Gallons. Done.

Thus! I guess max(two jugs) + target % minimum?

NOPE. let me see std;

It's close.

The correct answer is z % gcd(x,y) == 0!
