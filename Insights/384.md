## 384. Shuffle an Array

Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array.

Implement the Solution class:

* Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
* int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
* int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.

I want to use random to generate index without same and return the array according to the random index.

TLE...

I have another idea. Use an array to record all index. When we generate an index, remove last one and exchange last one with this generated index.

I cannot pass because in the this interval time, the shuffle result will be the same;

Knuth's algorithm.

we can exchange it with it postorder's node.
