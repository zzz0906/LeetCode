## 133. Clone Graph

It was a recursive clone for each node? I think.

Oh, I understand why this problem is a medium problem. We may have clone this node before. We shall not clone two same nodes.

I add a vector to record the nodes we have cloned.

Yes, this solution is correct. faster than 97.26%.
