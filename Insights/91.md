## 91. Decode Ways

It certainly a DP problem. It'a problem of splitting the numbers into the different ways with 1..26 numbers.

1345=> 1,3,4,5 => 13,4,5

Therefore we mostly can divide it into 2 numbers 10-26

xxxxab = xxxxa,b + xxxx (ab)[when ab <= 26 and a != 0]

**atention** there is no 0 in the a-z. which means 40 => 0

OH...NO, I cannot use recursive. I shall use DP which more faster.

F[i] means before index i we can construct.

if s[i] == '0' f[i] = f[i-2] if s[i-1] != 1 or 2 then return 0. because no 00 30 40 ...

else f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]

Yes I accepted by dp. I real recognize how to use DP.
