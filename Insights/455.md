## 455. Assign Cookies

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

It's a clear greedy problem. We need to let smaller cookie be assigned to child whose greed factor is samller.

Thus, we can sort it, and compare these values in the order. For the first child who have the smallest greed factor, we will try to assign the smaller cookie. We need to scan the cookie list in the order.

if there is a satisfication relationship, answer ++ and move to the next child.

AC!
