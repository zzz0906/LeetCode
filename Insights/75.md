## 75. Sort Colors

A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

I see this problem and I want to use a bucket array. But I can only use one pass algorithm. 

I see the std and understand. we can record a point for the start of the array, and a point for the end of the array. Then we scan the array, when we meet a 1, we can just ignore. if we meet a 2, we need to swap it with the end of the array, cause it shall be at the end. and if we meet a 0, we need to swap it with the start of the array.

Attention, we still need to find the i-- for this problem. if we swap with the end of the array, we need to search the end of the array again. 

It's a really clever idea.
