## 328. Odd Even Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

Follow up: Could you solve it in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity?

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

1 3 2 4

1 3 5 2 4 6

first find the finally odd one. Then link the even one to the last.

YES AC! pay attention to the even and odd numbre
