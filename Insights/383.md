## 383. Ransom Note

Given two stings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

just summary their number of letters and determine whether we minus random note's letters, if there is a -1 in the string.

time complexity is o(max(length of string))
