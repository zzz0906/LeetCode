## 176. Second Highest Salary

SQL just 30 accepted rates? let me do it.

It's easy to select the second highest salary use 1,1; it's hard to return null maybe we need to use if else

we can use if null to let the null value to be set as nulll

**we need to remove duplicates! therefore we need to use distinct**

**we can select * as xxx directly**
