## 413. Arithmetic Slices

An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

first we can construct the diff array. The answer turn into the consecutive two number.

Then, we can use a pointer and extend the pointer until we cannot find any the same value. and we can use start and end to delete the duplicates?

set<pairt<int,int>>? let me try. oh we do not need it. Because each answer must has a start, we do the search for each start position!

AC!
