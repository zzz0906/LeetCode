## 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.

I seem to finish this problem before. 

found this i,j,k we only need record the minimum form 0 - i and i - j

We need do it in o(n)

oh i understand, we need to record the min form the begin, and then record the second mini and if there exist the third minimum then return ture; else return false;


i am close!! there are two vlaue m1,m2;nums[i] < m1; m1 = nums[i]; m1 < nums[i] and numns[i] > m2

Yes. AC! Be calm to think about; from min1 to min2 and construct min3; we select min2 must be bigger than min1 because it means huge than before minimum's mininmum!

That was so close;
