## 330. Patching Array

Given a sorted integer array nums and an integer n, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range [1, n] inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array.

Return the minimum number of patches required.

first, we can compute all combinations; then we need to find which values are needed

so brute force... why all problems I think are brute force..

The std's description is not so clear. But the code is correct. For this problem, first, we to find a pattern.

we need to set one pointer. point the biggest elements we have added to the answer. the maximum value we can represent from this array is sum of this array. And we can represent variable from 1-maximum. So we need to add new maximum = original maximum + 1 and new maximum = original maximum + original maximum + 1; expense (answer) + 1;

if a array elements is < current maximum; this means, we don't need to pay anything to let new maximum = original maximum + this elements;

It's like a DP problem. But we only record the past maximum; but dp need records all value in the past.
