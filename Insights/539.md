## 539. Minimum Time Difference

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

We can transfer the hour minutes to the only minutes value. h*24 + minute. And diff will be min(a-b, 24 - max(a,b) + min(a,b)).

sort it and compare the diff between these values one by one. And a edge case is the diff between the start and end, such as min(end-start, 24 - end + start). AC!
