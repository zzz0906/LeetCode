## 627. Swap Salary

Table: Salary

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

select case when? when equal to f we set it as m otherwise as m? One tricky things. We need to read the problem description carefully!! We need to update salary, do not use select.
