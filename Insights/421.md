## 421. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array

Given an integer array nums, return the maximum result of nums[i] XOR nums[j], where 0 <= i <= j < n.

First put all the elements of the array into a trie. xor itself = 0. And we need to expand them into the same length.

OH, I also have done before. I have a little memory.

My new code is more elegant, but longer.

Today I finish this problem again with more elegant code but more time to debug with following bugs

* Forget to transfer to binary with reverse operation
* If we go to the son of current node, the multiplication all need to /2 (because bit operations)
