## 283. Move Zeroes

Easy question. Just remove all zeroes from the array.

we can record two array and concat them one for zeroes and another for general numbers.

oh...You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.

how about exchange? yeah! AC!
