## 22 Generate Parentheses
it seems apparently, we choose a place to add the ();
the begin, inter and end, in this way we can get that:
xxxx
we can search all the answer however TLE...

It's a really simple question...we can just
add a left add a right, and keep the right > current left that's would be right. It's very fancy written style let me analysis it:

If we keep there must be a right < left
first ()
then (()), (()). If we can add a left first, then add the right > left
in the first we add ( -> (( -> ((())) (()(()) this way because we need to go back to find the next standard position
