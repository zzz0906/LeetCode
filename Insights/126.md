## 126. Word Ladder II

It's an interesting question. We only need to know use the dictionary words to tranfer one word to another target.

I think maybe dfs is the right answer? The std use bfs. I think the dfs the time complexity is almost the same efficiency.

And it need the shortest!!! we can conduct pruning here. We can not bigger than current known answer.

The dfs is great now...but TLE. I need more efficiency.

Oh I understand why bfs is more efficient. Because we need the shortest. If we find a answer. WE can shut down because other answer is not important.

Let me code a bfs tomorrow.

I use bfs but still TLE. I know the difference between my program and std!!! **I iterate wordlist to find the one diff string. But the std use the string.size() * 'a' - 'z'. It change the current string to find whether the modified one existing in the wordlist**.
