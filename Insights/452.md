## 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Abstract the problem, we need to find the minimum intersection to overaly these intervals.

we can scan the intervals, and find the intersection which still contain the last intervals. For example, 1:[1-3] 2:[3-5] 3:[5-6] when we scan to 3, though it still has a interval with 2 but we need to shot now. Because if we do not shoot the balloon, the first one will never burst.

Also, when we add a new interval, we need to update the left value as the minimum value.
