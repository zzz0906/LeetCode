## 519. Random Flip Matrix

There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.

Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of your language and optimize the time and space complexity.

Implement the Solution class:

* Solution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.
* int[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.
* void reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.

how about use two unordered_set? each set represent the indices of all 0 or all 1. indicies(i,j) to represent the matrix value in this indices is 0/1. And random I will random choose one element in the set.

I still have to use a fixed random to do it. We still have to store indicies in the vector and generate a random index but how to delete it efficenity. 

The difficulty of this problem is to random get, O(1) access, O(1) delete. If we use map and use the index as the key value, 0, 1 to represent the indicies.  I don't know...

the std map indices -> x,y index. Yep, my idea is close...we can swap the radom indix to the end of the index...

holy shit!!! I have done a similar problem before.  random index -> real index and swap to the end of the array.
