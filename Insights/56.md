## 56. Merge Intervals

How familiar question. In my high school we know about the segment TREE. Maybe using lazy tag? like 1-18 if 1-3 2-6 overlap, 

The most easiest way is to use bucket. 

Oh, I cannot do it in this way. It must happen a overlap problem. If not like [1-4] [5-6] shall *not be* [1-6] *shall be* [1-4] [5-6]

Let me use some sort algorithm.

We can set two arrays. one for start of the interval one for end of the interval.
then one array for storing the start of intervals
one for storing the end of intervals.

we interate the start and end as 0.

if next start (nows+1) > now end (nowe) then we nowend ++ continue find unitl no next start < now end. Then we add the initial start and now end as a interval. Or the end is the last end. we cannot find more end.

Accept!
