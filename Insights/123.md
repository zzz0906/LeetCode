## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
It's a hard question, we need to sell the stock before we buy it again but we only have two chance to do the transactions.

It's hard than 120,121,122. I see the std solution. It use DP. 

we need to define f[i][j] as the maximum profit in i days and j times transactions.

And std define two array, one for local array as the last transaction is in the jth day and global which do not need to last transaction is in the j th day.

the local shall be transfered from the 
1. buy today Global(i-1, j-1)
2. buy yesterday i-1 days and j-1 transaction global value + i-1,i diff 
3. buy more days ago but sell in yesterday local(i-1,j) but we shall sell it today

and the global answer shall be tranfered from local and yesterday's global results.
