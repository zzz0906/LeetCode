## 561. Array Partition

Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

Clearly greedy. Sort them and let bigger to be a pair. And each time use smaller one a,b,c,d use a and c as our sum target. So we need to skip 2 steps.

AC!
