## 54. Spiral Matrix
Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

It's a circle shape. I have done this in my high school. We right down left up right .... repeat until no way to go. If we have been to some place, we flag this place true. We need to walk through all nodes.

I do not want to implement it today. It's too basic. Let me explore more efficiency solution. 

Nope there is more complex solution. 

*Attention:this solution we can know that we use a array to represent the up down right left. It really flexible and reconstruct for us.*
