## 219. Contains Duplicate II

Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

I seem to have solve this problem before?

i to find i-k - i + k?

O(i*k)

better map index value to
