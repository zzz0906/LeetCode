## 203. Remove Linked List Elements

Boring and easy...

AC...

Acutally, there are some tricks. First, you need to consider

1. head is null
2. head is not null but only one head with specific val
3. head is not null but only one head without specific val
4. there are several nodes in the list, but head with the specific val, therefore you need to find the head whose val is not specific val first. 
5. after above process, if it's null return null
6. else let last = head and current = head->next and begin iteration
7. current->val = val let last ->next = current->next
8. current->val != val, then we can know that last =current and current = current->next

Basically, I think we must consider above 8 situations.
