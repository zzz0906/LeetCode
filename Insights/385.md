## 385. Mini Parser

Given a string s represents the serialization of a nested list, implement a parser to deserialize it and return the deserialized NestedInteger.

Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

We shall use stack either way?

the std use recursion. we only do one thing. append integer and append deserilize the string including []; 

for example, [xxx,xxx,xxx] we only care the xxx so, if we face a [ in xx we will let count ++; until we face a ] we'll let count --; when count == 0 and we face a , that means we can append deserilize this substring.!

This idea is so perfect to implement as recursive. It can help us solve this hard question.
