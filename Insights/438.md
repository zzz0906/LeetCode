## 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

I guess we can use following algorithm:

* brute force: n^2 iterate all possibilities of start and end of substring, and compare them to the requirements.
* Optimization: record the start and ends, move these two pointer, when the requirements cannot be satisified just move the start.

Attention: when start == end also cannot satisfy the requirements, just move them together.

My algorithm has a problem. How to check whether all map is 0 then record the answer? Then length must be equal! So we can start by the minimum length's results!

oh god, how to do this efficiently! 

the std also has a slides window solution. Let me see how does it solve this problem.

in my solution, if right's character do not count in the p, I will move the start and end to the next character directly.

the std use a cnt to control the length rest. And he **will** minus 1 for the number do not exist in the dic. Thus! If we face a characters we never meet, we will never -- cnt, also we will never ++ cnt if we move the left pointer! Actually, it still move the left and right, but it will use a cnt to record the number of characters is existing in the p. It's amazing and beautiful.
