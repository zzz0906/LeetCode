## 564. Find the Closest Palindrome

Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.

* 1 <= n.length <= 18
* n consists of only digits.
* n does not have leading zeros.
* n is representing an integer in the range [1, 10^18 - 1].

The simplest solution is to calculate all the palindrom and choose the one who is cloest to the setting value. But the length of value is 18. So we have to use string as the integer.

11 22 33 44 .. 99
101 111

So the pattern is we can fix the to edge's value and keep adding the value between them. Also! 

For the odd length value like, we can have => '1 palindrom 1'.
For the even length value, we can have have => "the same as last position palindrom"

Thus we can use a recursion to do this. until the value of string is greater than the target value at first time for the same length. But we need to know the cloest ... high precision substraction... oh this problem is not so hard to think. But too many code to write...

10^18 < 2^ 64. Thus int 64 can convert!!

1. The nearest palindrome falls into the boundary of
            [10 ** (maxLen - 1) - 1, 10 ** maxLen + 1].
2. We should only consider the change on the first half part of n and
    reverse it to the second half of n as this will give us smaller
    results.
3. Then we we take the first half part of n and add 1, add 0 or add -1
    to it, then reverse it to the second half to create the palindrome
    candidates.
4. Then we compare all the candidates distance against n. Notice that
    if n is already a palindrome, it should be excluded from the above
    comparison.

Very celever and smart solution. AC!
