## 463. Island Perimeter

you are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

holy, I have no idea how to do it. first we must dfs from a 1 block. And from this block, we can continue to find other one blocks and how to compute the area?

if we go through one place, we can know that if we expand a direction, we need to -1 and +3. Let me try.

oh maybe we need to use bfs...

let me see the std. I cannot finish this problem within 30 minutes.

oh fuck... we can consider each blocks separately. If its around without any island, then it will count as 4...

my stupid head...do not always want to use dfs/bfs as brute force. For loop is also useful.
