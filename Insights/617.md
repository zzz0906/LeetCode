## 617. Merge Two Binary Trees
You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

It's a easy question. But if one of the child treenode is null, we just need to link the parent node the other one. Otherwise, we just get the value and add it to the first node cause we will return the first node. So what we need to do is to let the node.left = merge(node1.left, node2.left), same as the right node.
