## 238. Product of Array Except Self

It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Just get the prefix value and divide it.

Yes, but if we face 0!! we need to pay attention to it.

We record the number of zero. Using
```
if (nums[i] == 0 && zero == 1)
    ans.push_back(pi); //there are none zero outside
if (nums[i] == 0 && zero > 1)
    ans.push_back(0); //there are zero outside
if (nums[i] != 0 && zero >= 1)
    ans.push_back(0); //there are zero outside
if (nums[i] != 0 && zero == 0)
    ans.push_back(pi/nums[i]); //there are none zero outside
```
