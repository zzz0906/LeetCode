## 388. Longest Absolute File Path

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):

dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.

One question, why space is used in this string. a space is in the name?

when we face \n; we know the level comes. And if it's \t of last level + 1 we will new a next level node.

let me see for example

dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
⟶ ⟶ file3.ext
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

we can see in the above situation. we shall not reset level to zero. if it's still contains a \t\t;

The std's solution writing is so pretty. First iterate all these string, if current character is '\t' or '\n' then stop. for '\t' we will let the level ++; and we will only record last level once! If we find the same level, we will rewrite last level once.

If we find the '\n' that means we need to record current directory or file name. If a string contains the '.', the string is a file. And for each string we need to reset it as zero level.

\t\t\tasdasb => means level 3 asdasb directory.
\t\t\t\tasd.txt => means a file name + level'1+2+3's length is the answer;

AC!
