## 225. Implement Stack using Queues

Review how to use queue in stack. 

Just use deque which is too stronger to implement stack also queue but loose indexing.

It's cheating to use deque in some way.

Let me see std how to solve this problem.

It use two queue


first .... end (need to push_out)

then the core idea of this problem is let push and back agian to get following format:

end first ...

then put the end in the another queue.

in this way we can always get the end element (we do not use two queue, one queue and another element is also great?)
