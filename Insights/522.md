## 522. Longest Uncommon Subsequence II

Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

comparing to last question, this question need to return LUS for an array, which means if there is two same length string and they are the same, we cannot use the longest one as the substring. We need to find another second longest string. but if the second longest string is the substring of the longest before, we all cannot use it. 

holy...it's hard to determine whether a is a substring of b. Oh actually it's easy, we just use two pointers, and keeping move characters in the first longer string, and move the second pointers if and only if the matches happens. Therefore, if the second one is a substring, all characters will matches. And we can write this idea into a for loop in GO!

AC!!! my first complex implement in GO! Happy!
