## 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

Recently, All of problem is easy. return its corresponding column title in excel.

We just neeed to transfer 10-based -> 26-based

/ and % are used to transfer different based;

**attention** because it has 'A'-'Z' => it's a 27 based
                     
                             '0'-'1' => it's a 2 based

we need to / 27!

NO!! 1->'A'; then we can know 'Z'->26; BUT 0??

26->'Z'

26/27 = 0

26%27 = 26

27/27 = 1

27%27 = 0

2=>10

It's so hard...

Let me see the std...

it need to determine whether n % 26 == 0

we can see the std:

```
if (n % 26 == 0) {
                res += 'Z';
                n -= 26;
            } else {
                res += n % 26 - 1 + 'A';
                n -= n % 26;
            }
```

use - % and then use the / n quotient



Z = 26
AA = 26*1 + 1
ZZ = 26*26 + 26

which means we can -1 each time and / and % use 0-25
