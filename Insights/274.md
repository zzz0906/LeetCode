## 274. H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Let M be the length of the paper

2N-h = M

N (> h), N-h <= h

????

In the problem, 3 paper > 3 2 papers (2 != 3-3)

let me see the std solution

The problem's description is confusing. It shall says the other N-hindex paper has index < hindex.

It's a disaster. the problem ask me to do following:

1. >=h ' number = h
2. <=h ' number = papernumber - h

My solution is almost correct.

STD:

1. sort big to small
2. find an i citations[0..i] >= i which means there is h paper >= h and n-h <= h

we only need to find a i citations[i] <= i [0..i] >= i is the answer

BUT...

[3,0,6,1,5,3,3]

there are 5 paper >= 3 3 != 5

no duplicates?
