## 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes

The trailing zeron in the factorial => there must be 10 in the factorial we just need to find how many 10

1*2*3 % 10
1*2*3*4 % 10 = 4
1*2*3*4*5 % 10 = 0 

we just need to find how many 2,5; 10 in the factorial.
2 4 6 8 10
The problem need a log time complexity. 

STD tell us the number of 2 >> the number of 5, we just need to find how many 5

THE STD answer += n/5;

why? 125 => 1,2,3,4,5 ... 125 10/5 =2 15/5 =3 25/5 = 5

 n/5 = the number of 5 in (n/5..n]

 5..25
 5*2 5*3 5*4 5*5 => 5

 25 125
 5*6 ... 5*25

25 - 6 + 1 = 20

It's so strange that the number of five in the (n/5 ... n] is n/5

(a^(n+1) / a - a^n / a) + (a^(n+1) / a^2 - a^n / a^2) + ...

we can know that 5*25 - 5*6 => a^(n+1) - a^n contains a^n * a - a^n-1 * a

a^n - a^n-1's a. but!! there may exist repeat a we need to find the a^n-1 => a^n

a^n-1 - a^n-2 .... => a^n

therefore we know that the numebr of a between a^n - a^n+1 => a^n
