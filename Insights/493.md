## 493. Reverse Pairs
Given an integer array nums, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

A reverse pair is a pair (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and nums[i] > 2 * nums[j].

* 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

First, we can sort them as a ascending array. and lowerbound to find nums[j]. Oh we cannot sort them because we shall keep the position. Can we use another array to store the index information?

2*nums[j]'s element can be done in o(logn). Then, all the index > cur index. I remember, I did a similar question in my high school. We shall use fenwick tree. let me see the std.

this problem is asking, the numbers before cur number, the count of these numbers whose value is bigger than 2\*cur number. Thus, we can enumerate j and put all the value before j into a fenwick tree. We store the values of nums into a fenwick tree. The problem turn into the count of number whose value is bigger than 2\*cur in a fenwick tree. We can do it in o(logn).

oh, another idea, we use fenwick tree to store the index. and binary search to find the index before it. First we find all the values < nums[i] /2, then we only need to accumulate these values. Because we loop reversly, if it have been updated to the sequence, it means, it must be a index after j and its sorted index have been added into the index fenwick tree. Overall, we use j' v index who must be less than cur num[i] / 2 's correspoding v's index. And accumulate them. if we do not use fenwick tree, we have to accumulate them by o(n). in this way, binary search => o(logn) fenwick tree => o(logn) overall nlog!

m[v[i]] = i and find index by m[nums[i]] => find index of sorted array by using nums value.
