80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Maybe just scan and record the last one, and only permit the last one show up twice.
