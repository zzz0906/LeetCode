## 324. Wiggle Sort II

Given an integer array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

It's a array and we only need to put some number in its position belong to itself.

e.g., 1, 5, 3, 15, 10, but if the first two elements is 1,1 how to put them?

oh! sort them and small big small big! so the odd need to swap! (start from 0)

I think the idea is correct but details is hard to process. 

oh put the smaller in the even position and bigger one in the odd position

still wrong...

let me see the std.

oh in the reverse order. 1 2 5 | 5 7 8 9

9 3 5 why?

becuase in this way we can avoid the repeat problem. if it exist the repeat number like 5,5

it will let the smaller one to face the biggest one. therefore it can maintain all function...great!
