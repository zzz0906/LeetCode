## 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

It's a similar question as 117, but it does not a perfect binary tree.

That's cannot be implemented as this way. There may be the root->next->next->next has something and we need to link this two.

I add too many if else that's so complex.

The std if else is more simple. It shall determine the next same level node. if program find the node has left or right children then stop. A very simple idea!
