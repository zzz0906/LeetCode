## 461. Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

oh easy question. just << the number. and store current right most's value in the binary form (& 1). if they are different, we can add 1 to the answer. Until both value are zero.
