## 279. Perfect Squares

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

1+2^2+3^2

it's a DP problem or dfs?

n -> sqrt(n)? nope... it may not be the best like 12 = not 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 is 4 + 4 + 4

I suddenly want to use python to solve this problem.

I need to chage it to DP...

AC...yes just transfer the dfs to DP.
