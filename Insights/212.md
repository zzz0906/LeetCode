## 212.Word Search II

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

DFS?

brute force can pass...


We can use trie. but we need to construct it from the matrix!

let me see the std's solution

oh the std construct a trie for the words
```
void insert(string s) {
    TrieNode *p = root;
    for (auto &a : s) {
        int i = a - 'a';
        if (!p->child[i]) p->child[i] = new TrieNode();
        p = p->child[i];
    }
    p->str = s;
}
```

in the above code, only the end's str is not empty!

and search in the matrix and determine whether it in the trie.

construct trie for words + dfs in the matrix for the trie
