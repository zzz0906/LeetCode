## 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator

You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the NestedIterator class:

NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.

Interesting question. How to determine current element is a list or a integer?

bool isInteger() const;! It has told you in the problem. 

oh...it's hard. It need to use a stack or queue.

It will keep expand list and push it into the stack until the first element is a number. Really clever.
