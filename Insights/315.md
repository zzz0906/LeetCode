## 315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self

Search all the smaller numbers? n^2; 10^5 => 10^10

It seems possible?

First sort all the array and find the position of this number?

quicksort + binary search? o(nlogn*2)

oh...It only need the element after current element not all the element. Which means we need to delete this element after we use it.

Can we use heap to do this?

Oh...It's a BST. 

Considering following solution, first, we reverse the array and insert each element in a BST. And we summarized the elements who is less than this element in the BST. My solution is Argsort, Fenwick tree. First we get the index of this array; and let this index +1 in the Fenwick tree. Finally, we sum the 1 before this index.

The std use binary insert...However insertion is still O(n) which means it's still n^2.

And std also use BST...It's so genius. record a smaller variable in the tree and it will not add a smaller number twice.

for example, 3 & 5 4 & we add a 7, we will not summarized the 4 we will let 4 tags in the 5. But it's still TLE...
