## 619. Biggest Single Number

SQL Schema
Table: MyNumbers

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| num         | int  |
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Write an SQL query to report the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

The hardest part of this problem is we only can choose single number. My first idea is to select whose exist = 1. But how to get the exist of a number in the table? Group by num and count. And we choose the max number in the condition of the count / exist shall be equal to 1.
