## 282. expression add operators

Given a string that contains only digits 0-9 and a target value, return all possibilities to add binary operators (not unary) +, -, or * between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.

I wrote a similar haskell program?

we need to use dfs to perform following things:

1. choose last number need to be operated
2. choose the opertator we need to use

I think use python it's more easy with lower efficiency though I still use c++.

I record cur_position we need to start and select next number; also current expression and current val;

current is incorrect. becase 5+2*3 = 11 not 6\*3!

therefore we can perform calculate in the end;

OH...1*05 is not valid... we only can let 0 be 0

TLE...

the std use a diff solution instead of stack

for example 35+41\*2, we record the last round 41 and if this time is * then we need to let the value be the 35-41+41*2

ans-dif+dif*2!

and the overflow:

If the first 32 bits are not all 1s, all 0s, it can be judged that overflow has occurred

I give up. I use long long instead.

STILL!!! TLE...

I decide to use std's solution. my code is too ugly. I see the std has a similar solution.
