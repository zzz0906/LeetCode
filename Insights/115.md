### 115. Distinct Subsequences
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

subsequences of S == T.

I fell this question is a DP.

Let F[i][j] represent the first i char of S, the number of distinct subsequences of the first j char of T.

F[i][j] = F[i-1][j] (S[i] != T[j]) else T[j] == S[i]

F[i-1][j-1] + F[i-1][j] => we can match or not.

We shall consider this problem based on i-1 of S and J not **i,j-1** because we must match T.
