## 151. Reverse Words in a String

It's a easy question?

* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

py's string operations is really easy. Therefore I use python.

PYTHON [start:end:step] => [1,2,3,4,5] [2:5:1] =>  we select 3, 4, [::-1] reversed the array!!

" ".join([]) we add " " to the interval between each element of the array.

THE answer is threee line!
