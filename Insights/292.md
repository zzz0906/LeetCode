## 292. Nim Game

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:

Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table. You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and you go first. On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap. The one who removes the last stone is the winner.
Given n, the number of stones in the heap, return true if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return false.

dfs?

or min-max? or it has some pattern?

n-1,2,3 if i have to win in the last 1,2,3=> friend; 1+(1,2,3) (2+1,2,3); which means your friend must loose!

if there is a solution bob can win in the next round; bob will choose this one.

1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1! we cannot use dfs.

yes, 4=> how many we catch, the next one must loose. 

why: if there are (n+1)\*m stones, n is the maximum number we can catch. when we choose x, 1 < x < n; the other one will catch n+1 - x; then it turn into a (n+1)\*(m-1), which means in the end, it turn into n + 1 and you must loose.
