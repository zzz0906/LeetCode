## 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

Interesting. The worest case will be delete all the characters. s xx d xxx a  == s d a. Thus we need to find a no-continouse sub string which are eqaul to current string.

No continous string. We can match one by one until we have a match. Actually, it's incorrect. for example, eat, sea . We can delete the first a. But we can't delete the second a. So we need to find the longest common subsequence.

Because 

* 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
* word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.

Thus we can afford n^2 solution. We can find a DP solution directly. DP[i][j] represent the cost for the first i characters in word1 and the first j characters in word2. We can know that if i == j, we do not need to delete both of them, then the cost will equal to dp[i-1][j-1]. But when it's not equal, we can choose, delete both of them, one of them, three posibilities. Thus we can have the following solution.
```go
func minDistance(word1 string, word2 string) int {
	dp := make([][]int, len(word1)+1)
	for i := range dp {
		dp[i] = make([]int, len(word2)+1)
	}

	for i := 1; i <= len(word1); i++ {
		dp[i][0] = i
	}
	for j := 1; j <= len(word2); j++ {
		dp[0][j] = j
	}

	for i := 1; i <= len(word1); i++ {
		for j := 1; j <= len(word2); j++ {
			if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1] {
				dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
			} else {
				if dp[i-1][j-1]+2 < dp[i-1][j]+1 {
					if dp[i-1][j-1]+2 < dp[i][j-1]+1 {
						dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 2
					} else {
						dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1
					}
				} else if dp[i-1][j]+1 < dp[i][j-1]+1 {
					dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1
				} else {
					dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return dp[len(word1)][len(word2)]
}
```
