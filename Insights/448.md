## 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Given an array nums of n integers where nums[i] is in the range [1, n], return an array of all the integers in the range [1, n] that do not appear in nums.

interesting, can we find a efficient solution? like o(n)

sum them? (n+1)*n/2 but two numbers exist twice

oh i know, we can put the number in its position its belong to. Like for 1 we put it in the 0
