## 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Maybe add a flag stack and first we push root left right and make root as false then we will not add its child again.

YES! AC! But little slow.

OH postorder: left right root; preorder: root left right

we can add root right left and we add as the head then the node we "dfs" finally will be added to the head.
