## 90. Subsets II
Use 79's solution. But we cannot contain the same combinations.

I accept it. Even though I am little confused. first I sort the nums array. and get 1,3,3,3,....X some array like this. Then I use different situation to dicuss it. If the last one is same as current one. (because I sort it, the last one must be the same as this one or there is no same number for this index.) Then I only consider the last one exists situation. Because if last do not exists, and I fill current one, because I first think about fill a number to the answer array. Then if last one do not exist which means we have choosen the last one in a iteration of dfs. Then I choose a same value in this round but not choose the last same value,which can cause duplicate. Therefore, if the last one is not same the current one, we use regular dfs. If last one is same as the current one, we only dfs when last exists!! (including contain or not contain).
