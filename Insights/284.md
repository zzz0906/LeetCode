## 284. Peeking Iterator

a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

this is a confusing problem. what does peak menas? peek means we can select next one?

oh, after reading the solution, I understand the meaning of this problem. we need to use next to get next value. if we run peek we need to store next one into another value and next return this 'another value'. 

the hard part of this problem is how to use next and peek.

if we call next in the peek, we will reorder the array. we need to record the next one.

* call next directly -> return next;
* call next but call peek before return peek's value and update peek to false;
* call peek withou call next just record the next; 
* call peek with call peek and next before just return _value.
