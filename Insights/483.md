## 483. Smallest Good Base

Given an integer n represented as a string, return the smallest good base of n.

We call k >= 2 a good base of n, if all digits of n base k are 1's.

we can take this problem as solving the equation $1*x^0 + 1*x^1+ 1*x^2... + 1*x^k = n$ and we need smallest. Because it's easier to know that $1*(n-1)^0 + (n-1)^1 = n$ Thus, n-1 must be the answer. so at least we need to try to use x^2, so the other answer except n-1 shall be less than sqrt(n). 

* n is an integer in the range [3, 10^18].
* n does not contain any leading zeros.

sqrt(n) => 10^9 let me try brute force.

signed integer overflow: 4738381338321616896 * 6 cannot be represented in type 'long long' (solution.cpp)

I cann't...

fuck, this is a Geometric progression. just a0(1-q^n)/(1-q). Thus, n = (k^m - 1) / (k - 1). At least, k = 2, n = 3, thus m >= 2, the minimum of k is 2, thus, the m can be $log_2(n+1)$

so the std first ensure the range for m is in (2, $log_2(n+1)$) and k < (n^1 / (m-1))

and not like my brute loop, the std will generate the sum value by sum*mid + 1. And also, we can binary search the k here, because if we fix m, if the sum is smaller, we need to use bigger k. In this way, it has a better time complexity also, it will out of long long bound because the accumulate sum may be out of range. However, when we ensure the maximum and minimum vlaue (extreme), it's affordable.
