## 183. Customers Who Never Order
left join and its id == null means it never orders anything?

I was coding in below way. But I cannot select * from (table) where id == null

but we can use `where something in (table)`

Therefore I want to use inner join and where id not in 

OH...I am so stupid. Just id not in orders's CustomerId

It's a really really easy question!
