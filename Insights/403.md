## 403. Frog Jump

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

the last steps is k then we can jump k-1, k, k+1

dfs? it seems easy?

2 <= stones.length <= 2000
0 <= stones[i] <= 231 - 1
stones[0] == 0

the value of stones[i] is too large. we need to optimize it. dp compress state.

we can know that we have two state, we can move left jump and or state.

first, we record a the array index of current position of the frog called pos;

and becuase we use dfs, we must delete the duplicates search, for example 1->3->5; and 1->2->5; because we have searched 5 under 2's path. when we dfs 3, we can return the 3's result directly.

first, if the next element, we cannot reach and we can return false directly.

Otherwise, we have found a path, 

index <= 2000 < 2048 < 2^11
