## 532. K-diff Pairs in an Array

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

* 0 <= i, j < nums.length
* i != j
* nums[i] - nums[j] == k

Notice that |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

We only return the unique pair for this problem. It seems easy because we can just return the pair of int according to the minimal one. Because for the bigger one, we must can find it through minimal one. If we count both, the res must contain the duplicates.

let me try it in the golang version.

Finally, AC! But a special case, if all the value is zero, we need to jump all the same value and return a one instead of using a map to map the value and diff because value == value + diff, both are true. But we may only have one this value. Thus, it must exist more than twice.
