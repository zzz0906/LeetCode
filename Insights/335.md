## 335. Self Crossing

You are given an array of integers distance.

You start at point (0,0) on an X-Y plane and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Return true if your path crosses itself, and false if it does not.

The only way we cannot pass our self is go in a circle.

oh we can also pass away the first line.

1 <= distance.length <= 500
1 <= distance[i] <= 500

can we use a 2D matrix to records all nodes we have passed. 500*500*500 = 

Could you write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space?

The only way we cross ourself is

1. my distance[2] > distance[0]
2. my distance[3] > distance[1]
3. we cross the line before (complicated)

maybe we can record a pos we have moved

std consider all situation; and all situations are:

1. distance[i+2] > distance[i] (including my 1 2)
2. distance[i+4] > distance[i+2] distance[i+3] > distance[i+5] distance[i+5] > distance[i+3] - distance[i-1] distance[i+6] > distance[4] - distance[2] 
3. distance[i+2] = distance[i+4] distance[i+5] >= distance[i+3] - distance[i+1]

how to prove it...it's so hard.
