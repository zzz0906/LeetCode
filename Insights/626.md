## 626. Exchange Seats

Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 

Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

Actually this question is pretty straightforward. But I think it's a little bit hard to use SQL to resolve this problem. I don't know let me see the solution. There is a so fucking clever and simple solution.

We know that 1,2,3,4 => 2,1,4,3. There fore, we just need to let odd number + 1, and even number - 1, then order by this kind of "new number" 1->2, 2->1, 3->4, 4->3. But if we do this, orderby if(id % 2 == 0, id - 1, id + 1). The new id shall be rearange from 1 ... N. Thus, we use a rownumber again and name it as id.
