## 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

It's a dp question? Let f[i j] means we can split ij. Oh now if i j cannot be splited into two equal set. We still can divide the new array into two equal set. Thus how to solve it?  

Oh because all them must be sum. Thus the two equal sum is all sum/ 2. We need to find part of them sum as n/2. i to j be the n/2. Prefix sum and enumerate all i and j. N*N

oh prefix sum is incorrect. Because it's a set. We do not need it to be consecutive.

generate all subset! dfs. So we can solve it with DP.

Here, dp[i][C] stores the number of subsets of the sub-array arr[iâ€¦N-1] such that their sum is equal to C. 

1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

100*200 = 20000

dp[200][20000]

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-arr[i]] + 1

tle??? why

200*20000 = 4000000

let me see the std.


oh we only need to know dp[req] can be built or not. It's a one-dimensional dp question. 

if we have a new number. we can build num and any number N, [N-new] if has been constructed then N must be constructed.
