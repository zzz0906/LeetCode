## 193. Valid Phone Numbers

BASH again.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

we may need to use regex? therefore the regex in the shell!

grep -P means Perl regex!

we can grep a file directly.
