## 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Tha's means we need to split in the middle and let left as the left tree and right as the right tree.

We can use recursive again! Yes! AC!
