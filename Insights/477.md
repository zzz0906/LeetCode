## 477. Total Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array nums, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in nums.

I remember we have done a hamming distance problem before.

[461](./461.md)

Can I use it and brute force all of them?

1 <= nums.length <= 10^4

10^8 seems unaffordable. We shall use another algorithm.

Can we use algorithms to accumlate in each bit? I think so.

0100

1110

0010

We take bit in each position for the 000 we have 0; for 011 we have one zero 2 ones thus we count 2. In the same way, 110 we count 2 010 we also count 2. Overall, we count 6.

holy, ac! the time complexity will be the O(32*10^4).
