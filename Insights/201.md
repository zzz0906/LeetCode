## 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

the bit of each number can and together.

I found that it's clear that the interval contains the 

if there are 2^n and 2^(n+1) in the range then we can know the reason!

if the length(binary form of start) - length(binary form of end) >= 1 which means it's zero!

If else then we need to compute start-end's answer;

AC!
