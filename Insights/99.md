## 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

To elements exchange, which means maybe we can try to exchange the val of father and child or two children?

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.?

Let us see the std.

Oh...u can see that if we inorder traverse the tree. 

YES, we use inorder traversal. And sort the inorder sequence like 1,2,4,5 => then we can know that if it is in the order it must refer to the original node and only exchange two nodes. 

But this is not the standard solution. We must use Morris traversal. 

And I thnik the std use morris traverse like the general inorder traversal. record a first and second node. When we find an anominal point. we ensure it. And find the most higher node in the tree. I do not know why this is correct. But it works.
