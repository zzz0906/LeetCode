## 41. First Missing Positive
In this problem, we need to find the smallest missing positive integer in a Given an unsorted integer array.

I need to work in O(n) time and O(1) space. If we use hash function, the space is not O(1). 

**we can use bucket sort in the original array** What do this mean? We use the input vector to do this, we make a[i-1] = i
a[0] = 1 a[1] = 2....

But how can we put the corresponding numbers into the correct position? Well, we can swap it. If the number > length of the input vector, it certainly cannot be the order positive number. Thus, only it less than the n can be swap to the correct position.

**my own code report wrong answer however std is correct** why???

Because once swap is not enough. We need to keep swap until we cannot swap.

In the deep comprehension, the swap time complexity is to find each number correct position. So the time complexity is less than O(n).

**we need to determine whether a[i] > 0 first beacuse a[i] -1 can be overflow**

Done.
