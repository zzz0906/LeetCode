## 336. Palindrome Pairs

Given a list of unique words, return all the pairs of the distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

brute force?

determine whether a word is palindrome, we need O(N)

therefore the complexity for brute force is O(N^2*M) = 5000^2 * 300 = 2500000000

no...

if two words can be combined to a palindrome, it means s[0]...s[N] q[0] ... q[M]

s[0] == q[M] s[1] == q[M-1]

it's hard; let me see the std;

first set in c++ is sorted from small to big

the std first use a hash set to record each words' positions

the it's only need to determine whether <= lenght's words exist in the hash set and from d to len-1 is a valid palindrome

for example abb; we only need to find length < 4 all substr (e.g a) in the hashset and ensure the substr after a is a palidornme!

bba, a then we can paste a the first; 

So clever. use hashset to do the find operations!
