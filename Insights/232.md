## 232. Implement Queue using Stacks

like the above question one stack to store the first element of the stack.

only pop need to pop all 

Is there any easier solution?

a key property: a stack wo pop out 1,2,3,4 wo push them to another stack *up 4 3 2 1 down* then we pop then push to original stack

the order of these number is the same as original stack. 1 2 3 4 and the new one is 5

so genius! let the first in the top and each time we pop out them to a stack and push the new one in the top of the stack.
