## 85. Maximal Rectangle

I need to find the maximum all 1 rectangle in a 0,1 rectangle. Can I use dfs to expansion the all 1 rectangle starting from a point in the rectangle?

Nope, It must TLE. Focus on finding the regular pattern, It's another version of 84.

If we take the column as the x-axis of the histogram, and row as the y axis.

When we face a zero, we just cut it down and let it move to the 0 position. like

1 0 1

1 1 0

1 1 1

for the row, 1 1 0, when we face a 0, we already have a 0 in the third pillar, then in the 1 1 1 in the last row, the last column's pillow shall be 1. Thus, the answer is 2*2. We record a height array, and scan each row. when we face a 1 then let the height[i], this column ++, or if we face a zero, we cannot keep a continuous pillar, then we let the pillar = 0.
