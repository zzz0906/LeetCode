## 146. LRU Cache


THE LRU SHALL evict (pop the first) the oldest -> queue when get this value put it in the queue back.

(actually, in fact we cannot implement LRU because of capacity expand (time) we only can implement a likehood aglorithm "I remember it in OS course in PKU").

YES, the get need to update stack which is O(n). 

There is no both O(1) algorithm?

AND... IF it exist in map, we need to find its queue's place and erase it and push it back again.


STD use a int,list<pair<int,int>>::iterator

get -> pure O(1) (binway nodes delete can be O(1) and add to head)

put -> can be O(1)!!  need to delete the last one (record it?) add to head not exist in hash map
       exist in hashmap, delete it and add to head
