## 600. Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones

Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n] whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.

Input: n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule. 

The problem at hand involves bit manipulation. A brute-force approach would be to check every number from 0 to n to see if it contains consecutive ones. However, this would result in O(n^2) time complexity, making it impractical. Therefore, we need to avoid consecutive ones using a bit mask. Specifically, we can use a mask to determine if the current bit is 1 or 0. If it is 1, we can check if the previous bit is also 1. If so, we can set the current bit to 0, thereby avoiding consecutive ones. Alternatively, we can check for consecutive ones in permutations.

The truth is that this question involves a Fibonacci array. Since each bit can only be 0 or 1, we can use a Fibonacci array to calculate the number of permutations. For instance, if we have k bits, we can form 0/1 + f[k-1]. However, if the first bit of f[k-1] is 1, we cannot add 1 to it; we can only add 0 to it. Therefore, f[k-1]0 + (f[k-1]0 + f[k-1]1) = f[k-2] + f[k-1].

However, there is still one question to address: the given k is not necessarily equal to '100000'; for example, it can be '101010' it may contain partial results. Therefore, we need to accumulate the result of each 1 bit until we encounter consecutive ones because adding a value smaller than this one and accumulating it to 100000 would be meaningless. Thus we can add all f[len(100000)] + f[1000] + f[10] which f[1000] will form the sentences of 100000 + f[1000].
