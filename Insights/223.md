## 223. Rectangle Area

To find the juntion place of two rectangles.

It's like a Category Discussion method. More simplest method?

Let me see STD. I think this problem is a little hard...

First consider the situation without junction

if (E >= C || F >= D || B >= H || A >= G) return sum1 + sum2;

Without junction just compute the (min left - max right) * (min up - max down)

Also **sum1 + sum2 may > INT_MAX** we need let it minus the overlap part first!
