## 180. Consecutive Numbers

SQL today! find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Interesting. I don't know how to do it...i1 == i2 == i3 The last number ? I seem to do this operation before

oh oh limit? but we need the same? how to do it?

Use multiple table select => the multiplication of these tables (Descartes).
