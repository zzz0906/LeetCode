93. Restore IP Addresses

Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

1-4.1-4.1-4.1-4 is the ip address. 

Thus which can have [0-255],[0-255],[0-255],[0-255]. In this situation, we can use dfs...

First, we try 1,2,3 then keep tring until we try 4 times to represent the 4 ip address.

also, when we try 3 times in each 4 times, to try 1,2,3 digits. 

**attention in std's dfs, it use a &references to represent the answer. it really great to add the change value as the parameter not like me use a global value. And std determine whether it valid in 4 times determination every time.**
