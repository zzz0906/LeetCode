## 409. Longest Palindrome

Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

1 <= s.length <= 2000

maybe we can use brute force to enumerate all string and find the longest palinndrome?

...the problem is asking to return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Just record the number of these characters... 

sum all the even number, odd number - 1 and add 1 if there are some extra characters (odd number exist)

AC!
