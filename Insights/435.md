## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

I think it's a DP? or Greedy? We can store the number of intersection for an interval have. And delete from big to small?

we need to count the number of end end > start, end < end; start < end, start > start;

maybe we can sort them and 

let me see the std, first, sort by the start. And we delete one interval of these two intersected intervals whose end value is bigger. We use a store variable to the last interval, and if we delete one the last still be the smaller end's one.

* 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
* intervals[i].length == 2
* -5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
