## 542. 01 Matrix

Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

It seems we can dfs from zero cell and update zero distance but it may need update when another zero is more closer and dfs will not go to the same node twice. Thus, the eaiest way is to bfs from each zero and update the answer until we find an zero. 

The bfs is correct but not so efficient. The std can use DP, which is not a standard version because DP cannot start from up left to down right. Therefore, the first time we can optimize by the left up direction. After that, we update from the right down direction. Because the zero will come from up left or the down right. Thus, both two direction works. 

AC!
