## 40. Combination Sum II

It seems like a DFS problem too. Let us user a dfs to find all the answer.

Or we can use Dynamic Programming. let mean DP[i] = how many combinations for number i.

then answer is DP[target].

We initialize the DP[each element of candidates] = 1

OH...OH, there are problems, we will repeat using the candidates. (e.g., 1+2 =3 DP[3] = 1 DP[1] = 1, howevery, the 3 consist of 1, we cannot use 3+1 to conduct 4.)

I still use dfs, then I am accepted...

I think there is a better way to solve this problem.
