## 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

we cannot go to the same point twice.

like the slides window?

I don't know...let me see the std.

the std use dp; I also think to use this sollution. BUT! There is a lot of duplicate point may this!


OHOHOH! Impossible. Because it's a increasing path. therefore, it want to walk the same point, it must be <= current value. However, we cannot go to nodes that less than current value. We will never go to the same path.

Really clever!
