## 526. Beautiful Arrangement

Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:

perm[i] is divisible by i. i is divisible by perm[i].

Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

First the brute force way is easy to think about, just to generate all the combinations and try to verify each permutation is a beautiful arrangement or not. o(n!) generate and verify .

but n <= 15, I think we can do it by generate the permutation. One way to do is just to swap the value of the permutation array.

I cannot handle what's going on for my implementation. Therefore, I try to find a successful example and try to under it.
