## 352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals

Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.

Implement the SummaryRanges class:

SummaryRanges() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
void addNum(int val) Adds the integer val to the stream.
int[][] getIntervals() Returns a summary of the integers in the stream currently as a list of disjoint intervals [starti, endi].


[t1,t2] [t3,t4] [t5,t6] [t7,t8]  

binary search find its position like in the t3,t4 then pass;

if t4 + 1; it seems easy.

I found a problem, if we want to delete some elements in vector, it's o(n). Thus, we can scan the whole vector directly.

I guess we cannot add in o(n)...

the std use o(n)...

but std's logic is more clear.

when we need to update the interval, only the new interval's left < current interval's right and new interval's right' > current interval's left. In will have everlap. and we need to update it.

The code is so beautiful.
