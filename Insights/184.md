## 184. Department Highest Salary

Two tables; one for employee and one for department. We need to find the max value for each department (contains lots of employees)

The hard place of this question is to choose the duplicate max value.

Maybe we can choose to use join and to select all having the max value one.

It's little hard. Let me see the std solution.

PLS! use **in**; BUT maybe if we contains a value which is not max value in this department but in another department?

THE std is so clever. He select departmentid from first empolyetable and choose whether it is the max in this table which id == this departmentid. he repeat this process and get the ans.

for each id they choose max and use in to determine whether is max and choose all max duplicates.
