## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

just count it? yes AC...

But we need to use the prpoerties of complete tree

except the last level of the tree other level is full which means we only need to count the last'nodes

we can use this properties

in my way 2^n-1 + last level's nodes is a great solution

however!!! the last level's nodes is hard to summarizing.

Therefore the std use another method to implement this properties.

It summary whether current nodes have left most and right most. If it has it must equal to the 2^h

else just take the left and right as the new tree!
