## 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

Duplicatesï¼ŸI still can use above 153's solution to solve it.

STD use binary search to solve this two problem.

It's clear that the left mid right
left < mid => min in mid+1-right 
right > mid =>  mid in left-mid-1
else we have the duplicates we need to move right until left != right.
