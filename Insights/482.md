## 482. License Key Formatting

You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

First split them? and concact them as a big string. And all are set to upper, and divide them into k slice, the rest string are given to the first one. Yep, it seems correct. Let me do it.

AC...too many special cases. first the split string may contain '' - empty. Second the last one will be '-'. I need to process it more carefully.
