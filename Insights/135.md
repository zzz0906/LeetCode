## 135. Candy

DP!

higher rates => more candies but same rates => less candies

the minimum one => 1 candy. less than left and right => 1 candy

Then we can infer the next position's number of candies.

STD use a very simple way. If the right > left then let right + 1. In this way, we confirm all right > left.

Next, we iterate over right to left to keep left > right. 

**BUT, how to prove this solvment is the minimum solution?**

I don't know, I may prove it some day.
