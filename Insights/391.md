## 391. Perfect Rectangle

Given an array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [xi, yi, ai, bi] represents an axis-aligned rectangle. The bottom-left point of the rectangle is (xi, yi) and the top-right point of it is (ai, bi).

Return true if all the rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

no overlap, no gap. We need to determine the exact 1 if we use bucket array. It will TLE I guess.


* 1 <= rectangles.length <= 2 * 104
* rectangles[i].length == 4
* -105 <= xi, yi, ai, bi <= 105

the std use binary code. 

1. the area = sum of all these matrix

2. we assing 1(0001)，2(0010)，4(0100)，8(1000) for the lower left higher left lower right and higher right.

Then we can know that for the intersect node we will or them binary value. In the end, the 1(0001)，2(0010)，4(0100)，8(1000) only 1 value's node only contains 4 nodes. And if these four nodes has been insert in the matrix and with the same type, then return false directly. (must contains overlap)

And finally we detect whether the bit contains only one 1 is 4 four nodes.
