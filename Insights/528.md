## 528. Random Pick with Weight

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

Go doesn't support constructors, but constructor-like factory functions are easy to implement.

Maybe we can sum all the weights 1, 3 and find where is the value located in. This turn into an algorithm of time complexity of O(logN) N is the weight of the weights array.

For example, we have a weight array as  1,3,3

1,4,7 and then do the binary search to ge the index. Let me see the std solution.

Yep. This solution of mine is the same as the idea of std.

It's very hard to perfrom binary search very precisely for the go. I try to use C++ this time.
