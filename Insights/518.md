## Coin Change 2

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

Given coins array and ff we use DP f[i] to represent the coin combination, we can know that f[4] 1111 + f[1] 1 and f[3] 111 + f[2] 11 will result in duplicate combinations. Because 1+1+1+1+1 can both combine above two items. how to solve this problem?

Oh, maybe we modify our transformation equation. F[i] shall come from coins[i] + f[i]. Let me try.

* 1 <= coins.length <= 300
* 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
* All the values of coins are unique.
* 0 <= amount <= 5000

This method still have duplicates. for example, 1 + 2 (2 can be combined by 1 or 2 it self) and 2 + 1

how about do not counting the coins it self?  in my solution, I will iterate amount first and then count coins, thus, we will count duplicate coins. If our outer loop use to iterate coins, one coins only can can update the array once.

it still f[j] = f[j - coins[i]] but coins are in the outer loop.
