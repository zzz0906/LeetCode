## 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

See the graph in the problems. It really like the DFA in the compiler principle right? 

But, essentially, the problem ask us to find a path in this graph. The topology search?

Let me use map+linkedlist to do this topology search. It must start from JFK.

Fuck, I found that, if I want to do the topology sort in my code, I need to contrcut 

* inorder count
* the target each node can reach
* the target I can reach if I choosed last node

I misread the problem. Let me see the std's solution.

It need go over all paths. so to go over all paths, we need to build a multiset, first we put all paths in the multiset, when I go over a path, we remove it from our paths. we need to gover all paths.

Because it has a valid solution, therefore, the std just dfs, but dfs may face the same nodes, but it can gaurantee that this edge we shall go (because each path sahll go), and it must reach some nodes and finally all nodes shall be reached.
