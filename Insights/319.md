## 319. Bulb Switcher
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.

toggle every third bulb. It's a sieve?

0 <= n <= 109?


1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.....

1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0.....

1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0.....

so if I take this as a binary number? 2^(10^9)...I can't do it.

2 rd => - n / 2

- n / 3 but add n / (2*3)

- n / 4 but add n / ()

I do not have good ideas...

find the pattern!

1...6 we can know for 4

[1,4] [2,2] because 2 equals to 2 when 1 open all the lights, the 4 will close it. But it have 2 therefore it's still on.

just find all square number!
