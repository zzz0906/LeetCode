## 45. Jump Game II

Oh, it's a classical problem I have met it too many times. I shall use DP. Let me think the DP state tranfer equation. 
f[i] = update by f[<i], so the steps before one point cannot influence the steps after this point.

TLE.....
IT's an interval cover problem?

[ ][----]
We can transfer this two jump interval to the

[---------]

It's a binary search to find the last reach point for this problem?

No I still need to search in the internet to find the standard solution.

It's can be implemented with greedy algorithm. 

In 45 cpp we need to scan all of the jump vector and for each jump vector we also need to find the entry of each jum vector. Thus, we only need to find the max of the now and save the scan time!!

In the above std algorithm, we only optimize the each time we do not update the i+a[i]

we only record in this time we can reach the farest point of our jump array.
