## 572. Subtree of Another Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Interesting question, if it's a subarray, we need to use a kmp to do the match algorithm. Brute force method is easier. If there is a equal between current node and root node, we try to do a match dfs algorithm for these two root node. but we do not use past match information like kmp. That's the question. 

we need a T, size of original tree * S, size of new tree = S*T = 10**3 * 10\**3.

AC! yes. That's the solution. I use golang && copilot this time. Easy to implement.
