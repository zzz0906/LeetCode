## 541. Reverse String II

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

Let me try to exchange the character in place. for each index from 0, 2k, 4k,... we reverse k character. Each time we have a start index, a end, exchange them, until start >= equal. let me do a go version implementation.
