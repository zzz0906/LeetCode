## 57. Insert Interval

It seems a little easy to  use sort and find the start and end of the interval until no cover.

Yes accept! We need to think about three situation, {} represent the new interval [] original interval
1. {[]} continue
2. {[}] record left
3. [{]} record right

As for [{}] it must satisfy both 2 and 3, becuase [ < } and ] > }

Thus we can reduce all these into a interval. And then we insert it into the answer.
