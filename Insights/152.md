## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

I think it's a DP problem. enumerate all possible combination?

When seeing the continuous problem, I remember the DP with F1[i],F2[i];
F1[i] represent the included ith element max product
F2[i] represent the excluded ith element max product

F1[i+1] = max(F1[i],F2[i]*V[i+1]); I don't think this DP has optimal substructure!

THE std use this way:
F1,F2 must included the ith element, this way has the optimal substructure
F1[i] represent the max product
F2[i] represent the min product
F1[i-1]*nums[i], F2[i-1]*nums[i], nums[i]

The answer is one of the F[0..n-1]

YES AC!!
