## 179. Largest Number

Return to C++ today

we can know that we need to use a string to represent a integer. 

let big one in the position in the begin.

if there are two same one like 913; 91

we need let 91 be the 911; 913 we can know 913 = 9;1;3 91 = 9;1;1

3 > 1 therefore we need let 913 be the ahead of 911;

let us try this algorithm to solve the.

//if two current number equals

//31 315 we need to choose 315; however when 91 915 we need to choose 915; but if there is a 9 in the number we need to choose 9;

greedy is not correct? we need dfs?

Greedy is correct. becuse in the (//31 315 we need to choose 315; however when 91 915 we need to choose 915; but if there is a 9 in the number we need to choose 9;) 9 cannot be in the 315 therefore when we turn into 3 we can just let 31531 > 31315 

! correct!

I use std's interesting writing style.

use sort and design the compare style of sort
