## 491. Increasing Subsequences

Given an integer array nums, return all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered a special case of increasing sequence.

* 1 <= nums.length <= 15
* -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

we need to dfs here, we need to move to the next elements. for the python! use tuple in the recursion or function instead of list.
