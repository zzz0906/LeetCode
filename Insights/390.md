## 390. Elimination Game

You have a list arr of all integers in the range [1, n] sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on arr:

Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.
Given the integer n, return the last number that remains in arr.

I guess this problem must contain some pattern.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

first left to right 2 4 6 8 10;

then right to left; 10 6 2;

4 8; then the rest is 8. 

2 4 6 8 10;

2 4 6 8 => 6;

8=>6;

9=>6

10=>8

11=>8

12=>6

100=>54

110=>64

120=>62

simulation is log n? let me try. TLE...o(n) scan and scan again. It must have some pattern.

Nope...it shall find the rules of elimination. 

for example. 1 2 3 4 => 2 4=>2 numbers; thus if we know the two know number remain's numbers i; 

but we need to reverse it that means we delete the from 4 2; thus 4=>1 2=>3; more complex example:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; 2 4 6 8;

2 => 4; 4 => 3; 6 => 2; 8=> 1;

n + 2 - 2*k; it's our value; 8 + =  10;

10-2*4 = 2; 10-2*3 = 4; 10-2*2 = 6;

n + 1 - need/2 = k;

so we can know that; the 2 + n - 2*lastRemaining(n / 2)) is the answer!

Use recursion!
