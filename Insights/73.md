## 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

I think this problem is an easy question. We can just scan the original matrix and modify it. The reason is that we do not have enough time for scanning the matrix?

I understand what is my fault! if I update it first, there is question! this column's other row can be 0 too then it can be fault.

e.g., 1,2 =0 then we update column 2 all to zero, however we do not know 3,2 = 0 is updated or had been 0, thus we shall do as following:

if it had been 0, we can just mark it in a zero row or column we mark it. like 1 and 2.

This is a constant space but we need to run more interate. 

If we can memoize two array for rows and columns, it turns out to be an easy problem.
