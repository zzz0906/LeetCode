## 10 Regular Expression Matching
~~Because it just contains '*', '.'.
I think we can detect if there are these two symbols in the pattern string. If there are not these two symbols we can just return whether these two strings are eaqual or not.~~

~~We use a **pointer** to point the position in s we want to compare. We use a **proced** variable to record the previous value for '*'.~~

~~If there is '*', that means we can fit a character with any times; then we repeat the pointer ++ until we cannot find the same one.~~

~~If there is '.', that means we can fit a random character. we can just add pointer;~~

~~If there is a albert, we need to compare it.~~

However
"aab"
"c*a*b"

Output
false

Expected
true

1. ~~We need to skip if we detect one character~~
2. ~~if the next char is '*' we need to skip it too~~
3. ~~If we find all pattern but pointtos < s.length return false~~

Oh oh, it's not that easy; It's a **Recursion** or **Dynamic Programming** exercise. I refer to the **std solution**: I choose to use Recursion, let me figure it out

First if now position is '.' or a char then we can know that we just can match it with the string itself
we can if (p[now] != '*')
            return p[now] in {'.',s[point]} or match(pattern[now+1:],string[point+1:])

if the next position is a '*',  we can get zero pattern[now] then return match(pattern[now+2],string) or more than 1, therefore we can return match(pattern,sting[point+1:])
