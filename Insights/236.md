## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

compare to the above problem, this problem cannot determine the order of the element I input into the problem.

So we cannot determine the like 235. how about use two extra array to record their parents?

I want to use unordered_set to record the p's parents

and use a array to record the q's parents and reverse the the q's parents and determine whether q's parents one by one in the unordered_set of p;

It need more space.

Let me see the std's solution.the std write 1 recursion and its solution seems easier.

First for the current node, if p in its left tree and q in its right tree which means the current node is the LCA.

therefore we can use LCA to determine whether there is p || q in the left or right tree

```
TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
       if (!root || p == root || q == root) return root;
```

```
TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p , q);
```

if left and right are not null whcih means we find the left p and right q therefore the root is the answer;

if onyl left or right is not null then we only need to return left or right whcih means we cannot find in the right or left p and q. We need to left the subtree keep finding the LCA.
