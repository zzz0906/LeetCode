## 139. Word Break
dfs: one word in dic can be included or not included.

I think using RE in python is more easy to implement DFS.

No, it has some different place, we need to split not cut & merge

Let me see the if the std use dfs. 

And it can use repeatedly for word in dic.

for a string we add xxx xxx xx until we find a word in list. if in we can use it or keep dfs!!!

TLE...in [a,aa,aaa]

std use DP!!!!

STING <-> DP!!!!

Because it satisfy the sub optimal. 0-j it must transfered from 0-i = true and i-j in dic!
