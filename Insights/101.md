## 101. Symmetric Tree

It's a easy question. We only need to determine whether the left tree and right tree is the same tree.

I recently find use one line in the dfs like return dfs() && dfs () is really convenient.

Oh it need symmetric. Not the same tree. Therefore the left shall be the right and the right shall be the left.

Yes accept. It's easy.
