## 313. Super Ugly Number

The question give us the factor we need. Assuming the first one a1, a1*minimum;

Oh it's heap, right?

1 a1 a2; 1 1*a1 

we maintain two heap. one is the multiplicand another is the multiplierï¼Ÿ

I still see how std solve this problem. Remeber: maintain the minimum for each primes;

pointer(1,1,1,1); * [2,7,13,19] = [2,7,13,19]

pointer(2,1,1,1) * [2,7,13,19] = [4,7,13,19]

pointer(3,1,1,1)* [2,7,13,19] = [8,7,13,19]

pointer(3,2,1,1) * [2,7,13,19] = [8,14,13,19]

why? think carefully. All the number in the sequence must contains the factor. Which means it must be the minimum number * sequence

the minimum one is the minimum(each factors * each minimum pointer)

also vector initialize: vector res(number,value);

also the same minimum value the std solution give a perfect solution. It let all minimum value ++;
