## 137. Single Number II

No extra space. linear time complexity. 

2 2 3 2 we should use the space they give, but how? 

STD!! use bit manipulation that's so complicated.

First we construct three variable one two three to represent how many times 1' happens in a bit.

if a number exists once times, then the one shall be one. twice "one" = 0. Third "one" = 1. We use XOR!
if a number exists twice times, one shall be one and current shall be one! and once "two" = 1 then it will be 1
if a number exists third times, three shall be one when one was one and two was one

then one & ~three (only when three = 1, it wll be zero)

answer is one.
