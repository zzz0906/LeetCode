## 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II
I think it's a little hard problem. 
Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

We got a sorted array. Therefore, we only find a interval and let left is the left tree.

I use std code and find that it use c++ 11 perfectly. First when we only have one number it must be a root (the leaf of the last recursion).
