## 306. Additive Number

A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Important Examples:

199100199:

Output: true

1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199

so, we need to search the combination?

yes, when we fixed the first two number then we can get the whole array!

oh the std answer use a lazy code! they fixed the first two number and keep add them until its size is bigger than current string size. 

then determine whether two number is equal or not!

AC! It's a great question!
