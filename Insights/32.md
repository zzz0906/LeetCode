## 32 Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

It is a parentheses problem again. 

If we use dfs, we only need to add the left parenthesis, and choose if or if do not match right parenthesis. 

Can we use DP? I don't think so. I still cannot know how to decide whether there are Aftereffect.

I refer to the website

It's exactly a DP problem. 

Let DP represent the longest parenthesis length before i-1. therefore, the DP[i] can be calculated as length before this symbol.
1...i, we need to find the before symbol, DP[i-1]

if(s[i-1]=='(' || j<0 || s[j]==')') 
    dp[i] = 0;

the i - 1 - dp[i-1] represent the begin of max length of the parenthesis. i-2-dp[i-1]....i-2 i-1

Update formula:

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[j]
