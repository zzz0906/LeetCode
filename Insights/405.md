## 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

Given an integer num, return a string representing its hexadecimal representation. For negative integers, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

All the letters in the answer string should be lowercase characters, and there should not be any leading zeros in the answer except for the zero itself.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in library method to directly solve this problem.

the negative shall trun 0->1 1->0 for all the digits and add 1 in the last. and in this problem, shall we transfer it to base 2's number 

it eqault to positive's number 10000000-(32'0) - positive integer

so the -1 eqauls to 4294967295 = 4294967296 - (its positive value)

another problem. the first compute results is the last position.

the final result shall at the first.

yes! we shall use unsigned int to store the 2^32 and - num*-1

AC!
