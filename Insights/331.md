## 331. https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/

Given a string of comma-separated values preorder, return true if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.

It is guaranteed that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

If we want to check the string, each nodes shall contain two value besides # # 

current i left right; 

but if we only have preorder travers, it's not enough to construct a tree. Thus, there must be some pattern.

I don't know...what is this pattern?

the rules in std:

1. the number of numeric values is one less than #
2. the last one is #

Also, if the numeric value exists before the # value.

Therefore! we can use a count. if we face a # then count-- else count++. if the count become negetive number during these process then return false! also, because the last one is #. if we remove this #, then count must be 0.
