## 450. Delete Node in a BST

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

* Search for a node to remove.
* If the node is found, delete the node.

we seem to find the node, and delete it. if it has children, then replace them with child, if child do not have children, we can only replace current one with its children and do not link the children.

let me see the std's solution. oh there is a situation that we do not have to move the current node instead the children of the children of the current node.

we need to select the minimum node of the right tree. a very beautiful std's solution. We return the node at each level after deleting. Thus, we can call the for loop recursively. And because we need to find the minimum node of the right tree and delete it. So we can call the delete node function again.
