## 321. Create Maximum Number

Given two arrays of length m and n with digits 0-9 representing two numbers

Create the maximum number of length k <= m + n from digits of the two

I remember I have done a really similar question before.

The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the k digits.

k <= m + n

brute force? I think it's a DP question?

We can find an interesting pattern from some tries. If the highest position is 9, more greatest number will generate.

we can use an array to record the position of these numbers.

[9]: 0,5,9

we can know the first huge number and its first place. If they are h and p. Also, we record the position we have used in this two numbers. It's a and b.

then, the new rest length will be the length - rest of another array + length - current choice number and compare it with k - choosed number. If it's still have enough space, then we will choose this number.
