Write an SQL query to report the names of all the salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED".

Return the result table in any order.

So first we need to connect the orders with the company name using left join. during left join, I will assign value 1 for the red. After that, we can sum(group by).And when this sales man do not have any order with red company, the sum will be zero. After we only need to select the sales whoes sum value = 0.
