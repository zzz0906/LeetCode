## 164. Maximum Gap

1. You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
2. Try to solve it in linear time/space.

sort is o(nlog(n)) 

we need to find the

I read the std solution, bucket!!! I am really familiar with the bucket!

first we need to get the maximum and minimum of the array

then capacity of bucket is (max - min)/sizeofarray + 1 (I take it as the density)

the number of bucket is (max-min) / capacity + 1

[min..min+capacity] [min+capacity...min+2*capacity] ... [...max]
[v0,v1,vt] [vt+1...]

and we only need to record the min and max and we can know that the difference in the inside of the bucket array cannot be bigger than the differ between the start and end of the two buckets

and we calculate the difference between nearest one and compare it with res.

YES AC!!
