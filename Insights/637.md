## 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

### Intution & Approach
Still similar question. Just DFS and keep track of the level and sum of the nodes in that level. Then divide the sum by the number of nodes in that level.

### Time Complexity
$$O(N)$$ N is the number of node in the Tree

### Space Complexity
$$O(M)$$ M is depth of the tree
