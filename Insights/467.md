## 467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String

We define the string s to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so s will look like this:

* "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".

Given a string p, return the number of unique non-empty substrings of p are present in s.

oh a little similar for the last problem. It also has the duplicates cross the string.


* 1 <= p.length <= 105
* p consists of lowercase English letters.

First, if we can find a length n substring, we can find Cn0 + Cn1 .... = 2^n

But how can we find the longest substring? DP problem?

oh, we can see the s is fixed with 'abcde ... '

we can know that, for each end of the string, we have n different substring. Thus we only need to count the number substring with different letters ending.

For this problem, we need to find a property the answer string contains. We have a answer substring with different letters ending.
