81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order. 

I think we can get the original array back. It contains the duplicates. It's a little difference with 32. for input [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target 3, it shall output false.

I am wrong, it seems really different with the last one. I understand why we cannot use 33's solution. for example, [3 1 1] [1 1 3 1], the 1 == 1, but 3 can show in the left or the right. 

Std use a simple tricks. we move the right pointer to a different position which do not have the duplicates.
