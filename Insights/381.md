## 381. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed

Implement the RandomizedCollection class:

* RandomizedCollection() Initializes the RandomizedCollection object.
* bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the multiset if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
* bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the multiset if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise. Note that if val has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.
* int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of same values the multiset contains.

I think we still can use list + hashmap. we can let it be the int->vector<int> which store all position of this integer.

oh...it contains a problem...fuck...it cannot update correct position for the new push back position...we shall use priority_queue as the sub architecture.

...yes std use priority queue...but it's not o(1) because heap insert is a o(logn). We shall use unorder_set and consider whether the current removing idx is the last one.
