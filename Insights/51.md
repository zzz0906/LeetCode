## 51. N-Queens

Classical Questios. We can just use DFS.

We can place a queen everywhere until we cannot find a place to place the queen.

I write a really ugly dfs algorithm. Then TLE...

I need to speed it up. 

I shall not use a n^2 loop to place the queen. I need to use to place a queen in current row! Yes! After this way, I pass this problem!
