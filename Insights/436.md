## 436. Find Right Interval

You are given an array of intervals, where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] and each starti is unique.

The right interval for an interval i is an interval j such that startj >= endi and startj is minimized.

Return an array of right interval indices for each interval i. If no right interval exists for interval i, then put -1 at index i.

Literally, we need to find right interval for each interval, if it's the most right interval, we shall return nothing.

each start is unique, thus we can do a map from start interval value to index. And find the maximum value in a binary search.

yes AC!
