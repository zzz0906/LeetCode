## 190. Reverse Bits

When I first see this problem, will the value be overflow?

the easiest solution for this problem is just tranfer to binary and reverse

**PLEASE USE BIT OPERATION**

1101 & 1  => 1 (res<<1+1)
1101 >> 1 => 110

110 & 1 => 0 (res<<1+0)
110 >> 1 => 11

therefore we can know our algorithm is that

res<<1 + n&1
n >> 1
