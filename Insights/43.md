## 43. Multiply Strings

It seems to return back to high school. We need to write a algorithm.

We need to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm to compute the product of two numbers.

**please attention that the number we need to shift when we calculate the product by our hand.**
