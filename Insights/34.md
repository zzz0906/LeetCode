## 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

It's really easy if you are familiar with C++ STL. You can use lower_bound and upper_bound function.

!! There is some difference between the lower_bound, upper_bound and this problem. If we cannot find the target we shall ouput -1,-1 instead of the bound~

The upper_bound shall be modified in this problem. Let me finish it tomorrow.

I failed to use upper_bound, we still need to practice binary search.

Let me describe my idea. Let we think about a binary search. If the mid value < target, then we need to find in the right. > left. If equal, then we can record the index and return.

Then we have a index, we need to use while loop to extend to the left and right which is still equal to the target.

Attention to: not found the value and the vector is blank.
