## 189. Rotate Array

we can know that we need to let last k numbers to the first k


[0,...,N-k-1]
0 => k
k => k*2

[N-k,N-1]

My sol has some problems. If we use last one to push the kthe one then => it may push some value in the last k and cover it...

Also, we can know if we just cover one by one it may go to the same place. how to solve it?

THE STD use reverse ! so clever ... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 => 4 3 2 1 7 6 5 => 5 6 7 1 2 3 4

in the array we can just swap n-k and swap k => this is easy to do in O(1) space!
