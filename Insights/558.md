## 558. Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees

A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.

Given quadTree1 and quadTree2. quadTree1 represents a n * n binary matrix and quadTree2 represents another n * n binary matrix.

Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

* val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
* isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

I think we can do this recursively.

for each left, right, .. four part. And if one of them is the 1 then return 1 directly, otherwise we need to continue split. Yes, AC. One tips, when the four results are the leaf and the same value we can make a new leaf node and return true directly.
