## 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

It's clear a recursion, for the children we need to process it as a new node flatten it and add to the current nodes.

the key problem is to abstract the recursion ways

yes AC!

what we need to recursion? flatten all the child, so if we have child, we need to call flatten again, And link the last one of child list to the current next one.
