## 165. Compare Version Numbers

It's a easy question, but it has some hazard;
first we need to split by '.';

then we get two array which are strings splited by '.'

we need to add '0' for shot strings array

then we begin to compare

we need to delete leading zero for each element of array according to the problem description

Finally we need to transfer the element to the int then we can use < > to compare them

if "equal" then we can move to the next element;
