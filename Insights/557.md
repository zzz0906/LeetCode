## 557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
* s contains printable ASCII characters.
* s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* There is at least one word in s.
* All the words in s are separated by a single space.

If I use python, this question will turn into very easy. We can split and reverse each value.
