## 15 3sum
if we just think about the brute force to find the three numbers, the time complexity is

N*(N-1)*(N-2)

It's too expensive. 
Let me think about sort first. Then we get a sorted array. We can just binary search it. (i,j,k)
if we fix an i, then we need to find a j and k, then we know that j + k = -i; we can find the k+i. we can use a bucket to store each value.

But you should pay attention to the existing of the value, Because the output cannot have the same value.

However fail, because it will have the probability to we choose a bucket and value is the same of value of the before value. that N^2 cannot be adapted.

Let use 3 pointers.j + k = -i if we point to i first, then we need to find the  j + k = -i if j + k > -i, this is a interesting question. the left + right is the most great sum. becuase the answer must between this two value. j....k. we must adjust the it between this two index. if (j + k) > -i k--; < -i then j++ until j == k;

this means the answer index must between the begin and end in the sorted array.
