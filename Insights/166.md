## 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal

we need to simulate the fraction process of the recurring decimal.

we add 0 to the numertaor 

BUT I don't know how to get the recurring unit

2/3 = 0.(6)

THE std use if the answer has been in the past, then it must be the recurring unit


BUT: what about 0.565 565 565

0.565 565 * 1000 = 565.565
0.565 565 * 1 = 0.565 565

565 = 0.565 565 * 999

565/999 = 0.565 565 

OH I understand!!! we do not need to face the same number of head

for example 565 / 1000 = 0.5 ... 655
            656 / 1000 =     ... 556
            556 / 1000 =     ... 565

this is the same remainder => means recurring not the 0.**5**
