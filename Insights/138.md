## 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

IT just like the graph. we can also make a node list and record the copy node we have made.

Then STD use hashmap too. Let just copy his code.

He use a node->node to represent the original node and copy node.

then when random pointer it can just use map[orignal node] to get the copy node.

I wonder why the hashmap can record the pointer<->pointer
