## 97. Interleaving String
find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.

It remind me of the befoer problem. We need to find out whether the one of the string is the substring. We need to keep the sequence. I remeber we can use dfs + cut interval. 

This situation seems more complex. Not only we satisfy the order, number and we cannot use two char twice for one string. Because it must belong to one string. 

OK, I have to see the std. 

It...DP again. 

Let me so how DP works. First, s1'length + s2'length = s3'length. And F[0][0] = true for dp array. if one of the array is empty. Then the other one shall be equal to the s3. let us think about the F[i][j]. Which means we use the s1' first i char and s2' first j char and combine them as s3's i+j char. Let us think about it. If we want to know the final answer f[n][m]. the n+m char for s3 must come from the s1 or s2. If it come from s1, then n+m-1 is come from s1's n-1 and s2'm. Therefore it come for f[n-1][m] or f[m-1][n]. 

Thus the equation is dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] && s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1 + j]) || (dp[i][j - 1] && s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1 + i]);.

**attention the string's first index is 0-n-1 but in the dp array begin at 1**
