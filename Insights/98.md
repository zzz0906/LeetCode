## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

It's my wechat interview question. The only question is that the all element of left tree shall be less than the root.

Maybe we can generate a binary search tree sequence or repeat use recursive like above questions.

Oh...ps...I am so sorry. That's a really easy question. I think if we can solve it in the wechat interview...I am so distressed. Ugh... That's a really easy question.
