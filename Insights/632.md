## 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
### Intuition & Approach
To maximize the overlapping region, our first step involves finding the initial overlap area. A potential solution is the application of a binary search algorithm, despite the complexity arising from a two-dimensional search space. 

The issue at hand can be addressed by using a heap data structure alongside the binary search. We can start with sorted arrays and utilize the heap to pinpoint the smallest possible range. 

To initiate, insert the smallest element from each array into the heap. Then, pop the smallest item and push the next element from its respective array. This process should be repeated until an array is exhausted. 

A variable can be used to monitor the heap's maximum value. The process of continuously popping the smallest item until an array is depleted indicates that the max value of this array remains the smallest within the heap. As such, the lower bound of the left range cannot exceed this value. 

The challenge then arises in defining the right interval. The right interval would be the heap's max value. 

An approach could be to identify the smallest max value, denoted as $k$, for each list. Subsequently, a binary search can be employed to find the minimal value greater than $k$. Itâ€™s worth noting that the time complexity for either step would be N*logN. 

However, this approach is not entirely accurate as $k$ might not correspond to the correct interval once placed into the heap. A heap is still necessary to ensure accuracy and maintain the smallest range, characterized by the smallest and largest values in the heap. 

Whenever an element is popped to reduce the range, an element from the original list should be pushed back into the heap.

Regarding the usage of Golang's standard library for managing struct values in the heap, it typically employs a two-dimensional array for the heap structure. This is a viable solution for our problem. Accept it, and let's proceed!

### Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(MlogN)$ N is the number of column (length of single lits). N is the number of the list.

- Space complexity:
$O(N)$ N is the number of the list.
