## 556. Next Greater Element III

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer n and is greater in value than n. If no such positive integer exists, return -1.

Note that the returned integer should fit in 32-bit integer, if there is a valid answer but it does not fit in 32-bit integer, return -1.

I remember this problem, we can just use a way to generate the next number. Because the maximal number is sorted from big to smaller. But how to generate the next greater value? move the first reverse order pair?

let me see the std's solution:

yes this pattern is partialy correct. We exchange the value s[i] > s[i-1] the i-1's value and who is in the range [i - l-1]. After exchange then sort the part from i to l-1.

Interesting things, the golang allow sort.slice only part of the slice data. And also the string format in golang is mutable. We have to use rune to represent the string.

BUT do not use lambda function with parameters whose name is also another varaible's name!
