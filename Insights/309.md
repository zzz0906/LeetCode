## 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

* You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
* After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

so, it's like a dynamic programming?  how about f[i] is we buy in ith day, the maximum profit?

I don't know...let me see the std's solution.

these problem is a similar problem...we can use three array to record the information we need.

buy[i] means we buy a stock in ith day's maximum profit.

sell[i] means we sell a stock in ith day's maximum profit.

rest[i] means we are coll down in ith day's maximum profit.

buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1] - price, buy[i-1]), sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1]), rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])

It's too complicated to understand the solution. 

It's just a assumption. If we face these problems agian, can we design these states?

also, we know rest[i] = sell[i-1]; we can simply our relationships into buy[i]  = max(sell[i-2] - price, buy[i-1]), sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1]).

It's a classical dp question. I still need to learn more about the DP!
