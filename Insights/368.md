## 368. Largest Divisible Subset

Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:

    answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or answer[j] % answer[i] == 0

If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

Like the 1,3; 2; 4; 8;

ai = k*ad = c*d*ak

Thus, it must have a smallest common divisor.

1 <= nums.length <= 1000

for a i, if we select it, we can filter several other values. 

for example, 1,2,7,8,9

if we choose 2 then, we can only select 8; so, if all elements are related multiplier. such as 1,2,4,8,...

then if we use dfs it's 2^1000;

we can use 1000^2 to know who mod who is 0. Assume i,j = 0 means a edge

Then we need to find a full connected graph in this graph?

OH? because it's a number it satisfies a property. 

If we sort it. the largest number can be seen as a root of a tree. 

Thus, the head->leaf node. We need to find the dp from start to the end. 

Thus, dp[i] = [i - size -1] + 1

also, we need to return the answer, we shall record it's parent.

AC. the std solution is so celever.
