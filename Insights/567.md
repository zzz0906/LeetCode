## 567. Permutation in String

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

It's easy. Permutation means we have the same count of the string. Thus, we can use a slides window. And during slides we delete the count of the character. If count is equal to the s1's count, it means the condition satisfy, we can return. AC!
