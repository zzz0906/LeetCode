## 410. Split Array Largest Sum

Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

 
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 106
1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)

C(length,m) possibilities

I have no idea about this question.

STD use binary search, so genius.

for example, the array [1,2,3,4,5] the maximum number of minimum cut is 5, because we can divide it into [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. The worest division is we cannot divide it and the results is 15. Thus, m's answer must be between 5 and 15.


and we know that the mid = (5 + 15)/2 = 10

For the mid value we follow the rulse:

if it can split less than m groups and its sum < mid value, this means we have probability to let mid be smaller. We will let right = mid.

we have the best property that each division or group must contain an element. Thus, the first division will be less than mid value. And this division will be less than m.

Really great idea.
