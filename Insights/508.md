## 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum

Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
* -105 <= Node.val <= 105

It seems easy to use a dict to store the number of sum.

AC! also we use a collections.counter to sort the dict. But what is collections? collections are 

This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

namedtuple()

factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields

deque

list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end

ChainMap

dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings

Counter

dict subclass for counting hashable objects

OrderedDict

dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added

defaultdict

dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values

UserDict

wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing

UserList

wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing

UserString

wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing

We use counter to show most_common in the dict. AC!
