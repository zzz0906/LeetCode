## 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

Just record current iterate place as memory!

The first minimum then we can get the next minimum.

next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.

O(1) ？？ We only can transfer binary search tree to a array. But it can only use O(h) memory.

maybe we can record the father node we have access

Nope...? I don't know let me see the std

my solution is correct! But my coding is poor. I want to let current can be the next need to return value;

YES AC. It's correct! but my written sytle is poor. 

I need to know that the **let n = node first while (n) {s.push_back(n); n->left} | while (n->left) when n = null then boom!**
