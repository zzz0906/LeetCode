## 523. Continuous Subarray Sum

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if nums has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of k, or false otherwise.

An integer x is a multiple of k if there exists an integer n such that x = n * k. 0 is always a multiple of k.

For the brute force solution, we can iterate all continous subarray in o(n^2 time) => 1 <= nums.length <= $10^5$, the time complexity of square is unaffordable. Can we use some solution like slide window or binary search? We must solve this problem by o(N) or o(NlogN). sum(i..j) % X = 0. How about preprocessing all the sum(i,j ) % k. we need to find the number of pair of these mudular whose sum is equal to k or zero?

We can let each number % k first, and we only need to return true and false.

Actually...the std use O(n^2) solution. (10^5)^2 = 10^10

the real std solution is using sum of remainder to find the same remainder before. We use a variable to record the accumulated sum remainder for k. And push the key as k and value as index of accumulated sum we iterate to. If some the same remainder existed before and the diff for the index is greater than 1, we can return true. Or there is some sum of from 0...i is equal to zero. Otherwise, we need to return false.
