### 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

It's a really interesting question. First, I think it's a easy question. We can just dfs and put it in list.

But the tree need to be done in place. Therefore, we need to do following: (according to std):

1. cut the root right to the end of the the left subtree of right.
2. cut the left subtree to right of the root.
3. let the left tree as null. And take the root current subtree as root, repeat this process.
