## 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

ou are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

for example, 5,1 cannot in the front of 5,0; because, in 5,0 there is only zero.

Thus, a,b; c,d; if a>= c; then b cannot > d and in front of c,d; thus our order property is return (a >= c && b > d) => (c,d in front of a,b)

we can use this property to to sort? can we? It's more like a insert problem.

We can sort them by the second value first, 

oh shit. Out of time. Let me see the std.

oh shit. Just sort by the height form high to low. And we keep inserting into res array. And we know that, the inserted value must be a high value. Thus, we only need to follow the begin + a[1] to insert.
