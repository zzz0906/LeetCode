## 218. The Skyline Problem

what is the red point meaning in the right figure is key to this problem.

the red point is from horizontal to vertical?

the std use a scan method and multitest data structure

multitest 

```
Multisets are containers that store elements following a specific order, and where multiple elements can have equivalent values.

In a multiset, the value of an element also identifies it (the value is itself the key, of type T). The value of the elements in a multiset cannot be modified once in the container (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed from the container.

Internally, the elements in a multiset are always sorted following a specific strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison object (of type Compare).

multiset containers are generally slower than unordered_multiset containers to access individual elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order.

Multisets are typically implemented as binary search trees.
```

pair can be used as <first,second>

and the std's solution is as below:

first, we need to put the hight to the heap

then we get the heightest of we iterate over's elements

we record the last highest element

if this time current heighest element is not equal to the pre heightest

which means

1. we walk to the end of one element and the last heighest  has been removed.

2. we add a new element to the the range is becomse more higher

And the ans's x shall be the update's place 's x and ans's y shall be current the heighest value.

I learn two things in this problem

1. multisets means heap
2. we need to observe the problem to find the pattern in the problem!
