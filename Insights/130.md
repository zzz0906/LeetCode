## 130. Surrounded Regions

It's a question about finding the surrounding regions, like the GO game. 

A huge mistake. I let dfs go left and right and left and right... I debug for 30 minutes.

And!!! This method is first find if the region can reach the end. Then we modify the 'O' to the 'X' one by one. And TLE.

**std is really easy. I am a stupid guy. we can know why there are 'O' because it has O in the edge. Therefore we can first let the edge 'O' and its connected 'O' turn into $. Then let 'O' to 'X'. Then let $ into 'O'.   **
