## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

We can just find the rotated point and binary search in the two side.

Oh, it's not to find some number. it just neeed to find the minimum.

just 4,5 | 1,2,3, or 1,2,3,4,5 |

| represent the rotated pivot. we need to find the ascending until descending.

Or the rotated pivot in the end which means no descending and return the first element.
