## 194. Transpose File

one-hot in bash... fantastic

awk is for each line

then we in awk (for) use another for we can store each column in a array

this line 1 col in s[1] 2 col in s[2]
next line 1 col in s[1]

therefore s[1] store all col

then output s[1] as a line finish transpose!

So clever!
