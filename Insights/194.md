## 194. Transpose File

one-hot in bash... fantastic

awk is for each line!!! defaults! the NR = 1 at first, and it start increasing.

then we in awk (for) use another for we can store each column in a array

there is a defaults loop for NR!!!

this line 1th col in s[1] 2th col in s[2] 
next line 1 col in s[1]

therefore s[1] store all col

then output s[1] as a line finish transpose!

So clever!
