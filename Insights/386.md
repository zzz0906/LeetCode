## 386. Lexicographical Numbers

Given an integer n, return all the numbers in the range [1, n] sorted in lexicographical order.

```
Input: n = 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

the idea is to iterate first numebr is 1's first. 

1 => 10 => 100 until we cannot let it be bigger than n;

then 101 102 .... => 110 => 11 => 111 112 => 12 13... 

*10 first; +1 then. After that return to /10;

this solution is toooooo celever!
