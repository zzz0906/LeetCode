## 402. Remove K Digits

Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

This problem is a little bit hard. the leading zero can help the number to be smaller.

oh, it's sub-sequence. we need to select length - k (j) smaller subsequence

1 5 3 2 f[i] = 

if we choose a number before zero, then we must choose the zero. Other wise, the zero can be leading zero. we can choose it to shrink the length of number we need.

It's still a monotonous stack problem. when we have a samller number, we can pop out the bigger number before. But, we only can delete at most k number before. Thus, the condition is back < c && k > 0 && stack have a number!

and finally we get a monotonous stack like 13579; And we choose n-k number at first.

AC!
