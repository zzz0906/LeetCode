## 178. Rank Scores

Today is still a SQL day!

I need to get the rank. A LOOP for it!

For MySQL solutions, to escape reserved words used as column names, you can use an apostrophe before and after the keyword. For example `Rank`.

This is really great hint for debug!

Also we can use DENSE_RANK for problem requirements.
