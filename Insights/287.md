## 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.

sum them and - the 1-n's sum?

oh...nope it may be 11

oh...binary search?

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? 
Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums?
Can you solve the problem using only constant, O(1) extra space?
Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than O(n2)?
 
Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums? => I cannot sort

I need to binary search and use o(n) to find how many number < this mid

we binary to [1..n]. get the number of numerb < (1+n)/2 through o(n) summary.
