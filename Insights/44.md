## 44. Wildcard Matching

It's a difficult question. I need to find a way to match the '?' and '*' characters
Maybe we can use dfs to solve '*' problems!

Yes we can. But, it's TLE. Let me think how to solve this problem tomorrow.

I work for my paper for a long time. Let me finish 44 today.
Wildcard the '*' can represent any number of char.

In the while iterations, if the char of s is equal to the char of p or '?'  then we shall move on. 

When we face a '*' in the pattern, we can use '*' to represent the unmatch character. However in dfs, we use all possible numbers to match the unmatch character. And in the std solution, we use '*' to find the less match. Therefore this match is minimal greedy.  

I find a situation that if the next char shall 
badac
*ac

OH!! I understand if the 'a' cannot match the first 'a', then we use * to match more characters. That's consideration is awesome!

```
while (i < m) {
    if (j < n && (s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '?')) {
        ++i; ++j;
    } else if (j < n && p[j] == '*') {
        iStar = i;
        jStar = j++;
    } else if (iStar >= 0) {
        i = ++iStar;
        j = jStar + 1;
    } else return false;
}
```
