## 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by 1.

Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

I think to the middle is the best choice? let me try, sum the diff between each num and the average.

oh not the average. You should choose the middle element. sort them and choose the middle element.
