## 318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths

Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters.

1. detect share no common letters o(length)
2. iterate all words

o(n^2*length)

0 <= words.length <= 10^3

0 <= words[i].length <= 10^3

10^9 need to optimize the efficiency.

If I use a 26 array to record the existence of each words' character, the complexity can be o (10^3\*10^3\*26). In my code I add a 2-D array called char_words to record each words's character. I use a words.size()\* 26. For each word's character, I will let its char_words + 1. For example, 'happy's h->6; a->0; char_words[][6] + 1, char_words[][0] + 1.

yes..AC but a little slow.
