## 260. Single Number III

Given an integer array nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order.

how do we solve single number? just use the xor! This 'Bit Manipulation's method is hard to understand.

The solution still is intelligent but hard to understand. first we perform xor can get the diff two element's xor results.

Then we need to find a object: use the xor results to get a distinguish condition for this two element

condition 1: a = a xor this element;
condition 2: b = b xor this element;

then we can get a and b. BUT how to diff this two element by the xor result? diff' = xor result & - (xor results) to get the 1 which is the 1 in the most right side. The minus value in the computer means the complement code. and we only need to 1001001
0110110 + 1 = 0110111 & 1001001 means the first 1 in the right. GOTCHA!
