## 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses

The only solution I can learn is to use dfs.

1-k; k-n; => 1-q,q-k and k-p,p-n

and remember the symbol

Also review c++ switch case 

...In my way it's the different paraenthese's value. Therefore the duplicated values are approved.

then keep use this way to add parenthesis.

YES AC!
