## 397. Integer Replacement
Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:

If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.

First you know. The log is the faster. Thus, we need to turn it into 2^n; Finally it will be 1.

Thus we need to turn it to odd. if its even then we let it + 1. Repeat this process until it's equal to 1?

nope..we can add 1 or minus 1.

for example 65535 we need + 1.

fuck...use recursive directly.

STD:

and the pattern is when to + 1 or -1 when the number is odd. 

**if it's the multiple of 4 after adding 1, we need to + 1 but when? when the binary form is 11 -> 11+1 = 00 % 4 (100) = 0! except 3!**
