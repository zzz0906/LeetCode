## 89. Gray Code
bachelor's course digital circuits. LET me to review it.

The principal: The highest number save and n xor n-1 => n-1

We can use recursive for this problem!

for 3 is equal to 

2's gray code

reverse the gray code array. add 1 to the head

0,2,3,1 => 00 01 11 10 => 110 111 101 100

Remeber add 0 to the head like 0,1 because when I transfer a 0 or 1 to a two-sequence binary, it will not have zero at the head.
