## 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n). 

O(n)? It seems impossible?

prefix sum + enumerate : n*n

Oh, I have an idea...

e.g. 2 3 1 2 4 3:

ans: 

2

2 3

2 3 1

2 3 1 2 > 7 => remove 2 => 3 1 2

1 2 4

1 2 4 3

Use deque instead of vector! and record the current sum of the deque!

AC!
