## 457. Circular Array Loop

You are playing a game involving a circular array of non-zero integers nums. Each nums[i] denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index i:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward, and
If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.
Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A cycle in the array consists of a sequence of indices seq of length k where:

Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...
Every nums[seq[j]] is either all positive or all negative.
k > 1
Return true if there is a cycle in nums, or false otherwise.

simulation? use a bool to record whether we have been to a node or not.

I found there is a trick here. for one time simulation, if we have been to here, it means we find a cycle successfully. However, for the whole cycle finding process, if we have been to here, it means we tried to find a cycle here but failed, therefore we can just return false. Thus, it conflicts. we need to use two bool vectors.

oh actually, if we have been to there in another cicle finding trial, we cannot say we cannot do it in this cycle. Because there is some possibility that we fail because we have conflict in pos and neg.

AC!
