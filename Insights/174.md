## 174. Dungeon Game

DFS? find the maxium final value? if > 0 => 1 is fine or the knight need to be - final + 1

OR DP? jsut F[i,j] = min(F[i-1,j],F[i,j-1])

There is a hazard! in the mid way, the knight cannot be die


DFS is correct but TLE...

It can DP I knew it!! DP with reverse direction from MN to 00

DP[i][j] means how many less blood can be reach in the i,j

therefore i,j <= min(i+1,j,)(i,j+1) - dp[i,j]
