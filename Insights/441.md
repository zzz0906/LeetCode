## 441. Arranging Coins

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

We can add 1 + 2 + N until its sum is ut of n? The answer will be N-1?

(1+(N))*N / 2 < n 

N^2 + N < 2*n

and it's answer will be the right solution for the quadratic equation in one unknows. It's (sqrt(8n+1) - 1)/2

and transfer to float first. no...float's precision is not enough. We need to use double.

AC!
