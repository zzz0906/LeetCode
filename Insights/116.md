### 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You may only use constant extra space.

Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

It's hard to think of not using other constant space.

I find a genius solution in std. if we have done the last level next. Then we can know the **right->next = father->next->left**.
