## 262. Trips and Users

Holy! SQL today.

The Trips table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are both foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table. Status is an ENUM type of (‘completed’, ‘cancelled_by_driver’, ‘cancelled_by_client’).

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total number of requests made by unbanned users.

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows with the cancellation rate being rounded to two decimal places.

1. find the ubanned users
2. group by request at
3. group by status.sum()/ the same group

First, I want to know why the std do not consider the driver need to be. Then I found that the std use USER table which include all users (driver and client) as the left table which take all driver into accounts!

BUT in my opinion, **a.users_id = b.client_id still need to be considered this times' b. driver id's banned = NO!**
