## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Maybe bucket sort? O(n) Or record the consecutive start and end. Nope it isn't O(n). Interval Tree? query -> o(logn) => o(nlogn).

STD is really easy. We can ++ && -- each entry in the array. for example, for 3, we try to find the 2,1, in the array. how do we find it? HashMap => bucket!
