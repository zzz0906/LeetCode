## 400. Nth Digit

Given an integer n, return the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...].

Input: n = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

9 +  (10 - 99 => 90)*2 + (100 - 999 => 900*3)

9 + 90*2 + 900*3 unitl we find our number

and calculate its correpondinng number?

n < value;

my idea is correct, but some details are wrong. 

the std is the same as me. but implementation is more gentle.

the std use string to perform % directly. clever!
