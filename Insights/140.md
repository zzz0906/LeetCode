## 140. Word Break II

Return all solution.

DFS?

I think a accelerate method. We must match a word first then find next match word!

But I do not know if it can pass.

Let see the std solution.


oh oh oh the std use DFS too. But! it reduce the same computation. The std use a hashset to record the dfs.

oh for example, catsand => cat,sand, | cats, and we put them in the <string, vector<string>> hash set.


Then when facing it again we just use our hashset. It can solve a, aaa, aaaaa, aaaa, because a we have put it in the hash set !

Genius!
