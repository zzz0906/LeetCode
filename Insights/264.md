## 264. Ugly Number II

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Iterate and determine? TLE...

prime sieve?

2 3 5 2*2 2*3 2*5 2*2*2 2*2*3

it's the past answer *2,*3,*5

res

res[m1] res[m2] res[m3]

res[m1]\*2 res[m2]\*3 res[m3]\*3

and m1++ if we choose these one to generate a new sample and use it compare with others and choose the minimum!

like sieve! in the heap!
