## 372. Super Pow

Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

The mod number may have some pattern. In my views,  We need to perform High Accuracy Algorithm substraction. Every time we - 1; then we will let it multiply itself.

1 <= b.length <= 2000. It will be TLE.

oh... the std is so easy, use your basic knowledge!

135 = ((1\*10 + 3)\*10 + 5)

x^((1\*10 + 3)\*10 + 5) = (x^10 * x^3 = res^13)^10x

we can write a quick power. 

But the std do not use quick power. I modify it to the quick power.
