## 18 4sum
It more difficult to the last question.

Can we use last algorithms again? That's not true, we must use another algorithm. Because if we use above algorithm, the time complexity is too high.

However, similarly, we can use a+b = sum - (c+d) so we divide it to the 2 sum and 2 sum. Therefore, we can make a preprocess, first, we can add 2 numbers. for n numbers, we can get a C(n,2); pick 2 entity from the array. Then we choose to find a + b = target.

In this question, if I am a person, how to simulate I pick the 4 numbers. I can choose ith, jth (>i), choose k(>j), choose l (>k).

Then we can treat k,l like the 2 sum problem.

Therefore, it is a O(n^3). This is shown in 18std.cpp.

**Attention: Do not let the index out of the array, because leetcode will detect it, however our compiler do not**

However it TLE, we need to optimize it. I found that it's my programming problem, I use another guy's code in 18 std with the smae consideration. Then I pass this problem.
