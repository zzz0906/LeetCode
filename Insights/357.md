## 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Given an integer n, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 <= x < 10n.

2 => 9 => 100 - 9
3 => 

111,122,133,144,155,166,177,188,199

121 

It's a combinations?

Yep, it have a formula to calculate it. 

f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2)

for the fixed position. And for each k, we need to sum 1...k.

Celever solution!
