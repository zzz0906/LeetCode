## 87. Scramble String
I think it's a easy question too. I think I misjudge it again. abcde caebd. In my understanding, if we need to produce a scramble string, we need to cut it, and reverse one of the cut one.
how about tring everywhere in the second string and reverse one of the string?

we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children. => the part of the string has been reversed

It seems a clone detection problem. 

wrong example abc bca => true ? why?.... abc => a, bc then it can be bc a.

I thnik maybe in the stack, there are some point we reverse it. I cannot simplely reverse it. Let me do it tomorrow.

Above is not correct!!! becuase it's a binary tree.

This is a typical recursive or dp problem. Think about that, for a string s1 and string s2. If it's scramble which means s1 or s2 has been divided into two strings. s11 s12, s21,s22. For this four string, we may exactly know that the s11 == s21 or s12 == s22. **OR** s11 == s22 s12 == s21 it has been scrambled. But it's not enough, because s11 is not having to equal to s21 or s22, it can be scramble of s21 or s22. Therefore, we can use recursive. This consideration is genius!
