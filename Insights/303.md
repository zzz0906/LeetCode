## 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

just record the prefix? let me try.

yes ac. hint: we can put 0 in the prefix sum to let the answer equal to the i,j i start in 0, therefore the answer is j+1 - i which will delete j but include i.
