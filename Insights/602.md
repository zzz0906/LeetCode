## 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

Table: RequestAccepted

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write an SQL query to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.

Follow up: In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

The request and accept both count the friend in this case. If you request somebody the left id's frend will plus also for the right. So the result is the sum of the two columns. so group by count and out join by the key and then sum?

oh shit. hard to do. Cause maybe, one of the table may lack one of the column. I need to read the std's solution now. 

### Intuition
When I first see this question, I thought it's related to outer join because we have two column. Then I found out MYSQL doesn't support OUTER JOIN. Therefore, we shall use union here.

### Approach
First we get the requester id and accepter id and name them both id. After that union all them. We get the number of request/accept. So we need to use group by and count to get the id, numebr of friends table. We choose the rows contain the max value.
