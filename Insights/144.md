## 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

144 need us not to use recursive. Therefore maybe we can record the next dfs node in a dequeu and interation.

OH...it seems incorrect. we need to go to the left before the right.

the right answer is shown as following:

we shall maintain a stack instead of a queue. and we shall push the right then left because left shall be dfs first. then we can push the left's left and right ... until we iterate all left's node.

AC!
