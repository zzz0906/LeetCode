## 393. UTF-8 Validation

Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

the first n bits are all one's, what about the n is excluded from 8 length. 11111111111 0 

Oh, i understand it in a wrong way...it can use 2 bytes and 1 bytes...

can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected!!! which means we also need to determine whether it can be huger than 5!

AC! I think my bit operation is practiced after this problem.
