## 520. Detect Capital

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.

the problem is easy. We can scan the string, the first time, only if when the all letters are captial, we return ture. For the second time, only if all letters in this word are not capitals. For the third time, only the first letter in this word is capital.
Else we can return false.

to learn some new languages, I choose to use go this time.

AC.

more efficient way is to check in one for loop. but how to do it? first if the first and second is capital, then we have all following characters are capital. Otherwise, all following except the first one, need to be lowercase.
