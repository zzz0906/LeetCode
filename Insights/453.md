## 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal.

In one move, you can increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1.

interesting, i can add 1 for all elements except the one.

we can perform add for all elements except the one maximum?

there will be one element reach the maximum, and we must have to choose one of the maximum. and next time, the other maximum will turn in to the second largest.

sort them first. 

I don't know...Let me check std's solution.

just find the minimum and because if we want to increment n - 1 elements of the array by 1, it equal to wo decre an element by 1! so the answer will be the sum of the diff between each element and minmum.
