## 30 Substring with Concatenation of All Words

We know that the we need to choose a substring for each index, st -> st + arbitrary length

However the words list is same length. Therefore, the arbitary length should be number of list * fixed length

Time complexity is O(n) n = length of s; Let do it.

If we only has one char, then TLE, GG.

We need to use another algorithm. 

We compare the each fixed length in the string using for loop instead of HashMap or Trie. I think this may be the problem of the TLE. It still TLE.
Let me keep optimize it tomorrow.

I use two optimization places:

    1. if substring size > end size just break;
    2. we use map assignment operations instead of add each words one by one.

Then the code has been accepted.
