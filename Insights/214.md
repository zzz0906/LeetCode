## 214. Shortest Palindrome

String problem - Oh Oh DP problem

by adding characters in front of it

Interesting

We need to find the minimum steps to let it be a palindrome.

It's so hard...

the std use two pointers, one pointers at the start of the string and another at the end of the string

and if they are equal, both of them --; otherwise the end--

for example in this way abbac, a-c, a-a, b-b;

In this way we can ensure that from head to where there is a palindrome

but attention **maybe there is no palindrome from head to there, e.g.: adcba a-a d...until nothing, i = 2**

in this case, the "ad" is not palindrome.

In std, we need to determin the whether head-i is palindrome and recall our function again.
