## 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.

brute force can solve it. But how to solve it more efficiently. I guess it's a n^2 dp.

if we use f[i,j] to represent the maximal length palindromic subsequence when i,j can match. It must deliver by, f[k,l] k > i and l < j and k > l

Oh it's greedy? we just match the furthest character then the characters between the middle. Yep I guess my idea is correct. Let me try to implement it. And we can use memroy-based to do the search.

My idea is correct, dfs/DP. But i do not have any time again. Let me see the std's solution.

holy shit... this is LCS actually. f[i][j] when not equal we can get from i-1,j or i,j-1. However for this problem, we use the string inside i,j and it turn into i-1, i,j-1. We can find that they are same. But one question is to shrink a string inside a string another is to compare two string.

Thus, if we want to construct some pair in one string, it equals to copy this string and do the LCS. Really interesting question.
