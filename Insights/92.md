## 92. Reverse Linked List II

Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in one-pass.

count it. It just a code problem. It test your coding ability.

OHOHOH 1pass accept. I carefully think about the count and we need to choose the split part of the link list.

I divided it into whether m == 1 or not == 1.

when m == 1 we only need to reverse it to record the tale and head. each time I add a new one and take this one as head. In then end I connect the tale to element after the n. and return new head. This

In the same way, we link the m to the new head. And we return the old head if m != 1.
